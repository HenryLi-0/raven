# Test Connection Firmware

This folder contains the code/firmware that should be put on the microcontroller to test communicating with another device over wifi!

- [`code.py`](</firmware/testConnection/code.py>) should be placed on the microcontroller!
- [`experiment.py`](</firmware/testConnection/experiment.py>) should be run on your device!

You should connect an LED or something to D10 and GND of the microcontroller to see it blinking!
