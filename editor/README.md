# Editor

This folder contain the editor for the system, which also functions as a simulation tool, so you can test your LED patterns before actually running them!

Hey there adventurer! Wondering where the files are? Well, this is actually a planned future feature! (I currently, at the time of this writing, haven't assembled the actual machine yet. When that's created, I'll start writing this!)

Note: This is NOT where you find the firmware! Checkout [`/firmware/README.md`](</firmware/README.md>) for information on the firmware!
