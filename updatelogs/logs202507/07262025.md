# 7/26/2025 - 31st Update!

aaaaa almost there! ok, so its 7:57 PM, updated the journal and some other stuff from like 6:30 PM to 6:45 PM, but yeah, time to continue! what did i do today? i watched some movie in the theater, which was pretty interesting (it was free, since it was meant to be some "event" from some organization). anyways, i got to watch the movie at a very cursed angle (front row, second seat from the very very left).

anyways, just remembered that we need to update the pin info on the firmwares for both since we moved the pins for the led subsystem and never added it for the motor subsystem.

ok, everything has been listed, was gonna change all the "A3144E" names on the led subsystem to just "HALL" (like the motor subsystem), but turns out i do NOT want to deal with the nets and stuff and updating it (doesnt raelly matter either way, it'll be the same board)

i really want to get a blender render of this stuff! (i forgot everything from the donut tutorials)

so, images and wiring diagram is on the todo!

ok, for the blender stuff just watched [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMfAVJGHMrM), gonna also watch a longer one. yeah, couldn't pay attention very well, but [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0B0OUAdQ6UI) it is if you're interested! (im just gonna try the first one now)

i... i have no clue how to use blender. dont know what i clicked, but its just frozen now.

yeah so i have to be careful on every button i press in blender, since i dont think i have the supercomputer computing for this. huh, guess its working a bit?

oh. oh, you gotta change your renderer, did a couple extra stuff, blenders telling me cycles is gonna take more than an hour, after eating up all my ram and cpu, but heres what 35 samples looks like!

ok, gotta find out how to get some GPU to run this, since my tables getting really hot. pretty happy with the image already though! here's the full image...

huh i guess google colab is the solution

kinda upset that i didnt change the color of the XIAO (its yellow oops), but looks good! gonna commit to see if this works on github...

oh, it doesn't guess this might fix it?
