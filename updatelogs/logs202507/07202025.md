# 7/20/2025 - 25th Update!

ok, got some motivation today, its 1 PM, and ive decided that today shall be the last day to work on this! i really need to get started on other stuff, and this has simply taken almost a month (which is kinda crazy long, given that we thought we could finish this in like 1-2 weeks). anyways, after this, ill be working on IVO v3, until i get some update on what will come of this project! (then parts should ship by august 4th or someting, then building by august 8th).

ok, first things first, i decided last night to look at yet another MOSFET, since im absolutely terrified if the MSOFET we choose isnt able to fully turn on at 3.3V. this time, i already memorized its name, the `IRLB8721PBF`. its lead free too, which i guess is a neat bonus. just check the datasheet and im not sure if this works. basically, the issue is that the graphs are confusing as heck, and that 3.3V GPIO pins seem to just "turn on" the MOSFET, but not all the way. really considering just having another switch just control the MOSFET at this point, connected to the 5V line and having that output feed into the logic pin of the motor MOSFET.

ive been looking at a lot of MOSFETs. oh wow its already lunch time (i just ate breakfast), i have an idea for the screw solution, but i requires me removing two LEDs on the motor subsystem (which im alright doing)

ok, 1:30 PM now, gonna look at some MOSFETs while eating lunch, back at 2:15 PM, ive looked at way too many datsheets and videos. its been a bit and just watched [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwRJsze_9m4) video for how MOSFETs work, and i think ive confused myself (how do you wire it???)

ok so i need to find a heat sink or something (im just gonna find some big piece of metal somewhere)

yeah so our wiring for the mosfet is kinda sus

its 3PM and i feel like falling asleep so im gonna take a break

its 5:15 PM and i think im gonna pause the MOSFET thing until later. worst comes to worst, i grab a BJT and use that on the 5V to output 5V into the MOSFET and that should do the trick. for now, im gonna work on mounting, then work on the programming side!

yes i just spent the last 15 minutes redrawing a qr code image into a 29x29 image in microsoft paint.

just realized i was doing all my work in the wrong assembly. anyways, had some fun with vanity, added the hc inside sticker and a qr code to the repository on the PCB! 6:45 PM now, heading off to dinner.

its 12:00 AM and im back (no i did not spend 5.25 hours eating, i was forced to touch grass and do other stuff). so we didnt exactly finish today, but let's keep going!

CAD updated, here's a quick picture (notice the changes at the base)

ok, quick commit, then some coding!
