# 7/9/2025 - 15th Update!

wow today was quite the day, its already 10 PM..., anyways watched another movie today, time to start working! yeah so today in the doctors office i got bored while waiting and decided to research a couple of boost convertors (since the current MT3608 we have has a max amp of 2A, which is quite sad when we want to power motors). anyways, found [this one](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256805882203198.html?spm=a2g0n.productlist.0.0.186529edWzCVc3&aff_platform=msite&m_page_id=mvipdhwcaawioqjm197f1148b831e07212c62465f0&gclid=&pdp_ext_f=%7B%22order%22%3A%22937%22%2C%22eval%22%3A%221%22%7D&pdp_npi=4%40dis!USD!1.73!0.99!!!12.34!7.05!%402101c5ac17520963580108649eed83!12000035596268598!sea!US!6405565024!ABX&algo_pvid=c5c05c22-8da6-4f29-bb19-0adee8073828), but it requires an input voltage of 10-32V, which the battery doesnt exactly deliver. therefore, we continue hunting.

yeah so its been 22 minutes and im starting to think there arent any boost convertors around for this job. so uh, found [this](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/2255800011462620.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.main.1.18b2lpAAlpAAaF&algo_pvid=556b5380-9541-4ed4-956d-35e1f915b3c7&algo_exp_id=556b5380-9541-4ed4-956d-35e1f915b3c7-26&pdp_ext_f=%7B%22order%22%3A%223088%22%2C%22eval%22%3A%221%22%7D&pdp_npi=4%40dis%21USD%211.87%210.99%21%21%211.87%210.99%21%402101ef5e17521136451725715e2715%2112000044237774496%21sea%21US%216405565024%21ABX&curPageLogUid=Ne4PmkucTc7K&utparam-url=scene%3Asearch%7Cquery_from%3A) but its limited to 5A in its input, so yeah. im kinda getting desperate here.

ok who keeps breaking the internet router

so i just had an idea, yeah its not gonna work (it was to skip the boost convertor for the motor and just attach it raw, but we need more volts!) yeah its been 45 minutes now and i cant find a good one. ok its now 11:05 PM and im just gonna take a break, ive looked through way too many aliexpress offers today...

ok im back at 12:15 AM and im honestly very tired lol, but lets try to push through.

[here's](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256805855172022.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.main.12.7795lnSalnSasl&algo_pvid=b0afe62d-f32d-4314-85ed-17e95cc84a90&algo_exp_id=b0afe62d-f32d-4314-85ed-17e95cc84a90-11&pdp_ext_f=%7B%22order%22%3A%22712%22%2C%22eval%22%3A%221%22%7D&pdp_npi=4%40dis%21USD%210.96%210.96%21%21%216.85%216.85%21%402101c5b117521210612946204e1677%2112000035452245642%21sea%21US%216405565024%21ABX&curPageLogUid=SWzPmyjDzBHM&utparam-url=scene%3Asearch%7Cquery_from%3A) a thing for 2A battery protection (choose `2S 20A Balance` or something)

alright, lets just finish this research phase, im getting really tired

what did i just come across

![what this](</updatelogs/images/202507/07092025 - 1.png>)

ok theres actually no way i spent the entirety of today search for a single boost converter. anyways, im just gonna draw a wiring diagram real quick (yes for v3)

yeah so i just realized that... this soltuion kinda means that i need a step down to 5V thing for the motor system since we have a XIAO that doesnt want to become a frying pan

yeah ok, laid out all the components, its 1AM now, im just gonna wrap this up tomorrow (yay dont have to go outside tomorrow since its online on thursdays) (probably going to school on friday for driver practice? probably a good idea)

so yeah, thats it, good night!
