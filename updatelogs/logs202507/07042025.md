# 7/4/2025 - 10th Update!

ok, starting today at 2:20 PM instead of the previous couple days! fist things first, im gonna update the PCBs!

ok, been doing some work, then just remembered that i needed to update the license (since, GNU GPL v3 is kinda a more software thing). just updated it, with `CERN-OHL-S v2` for the hardware and `GNU GPL v3` for the software! that should keep everything open source! ok, quick commit, PCB work is still being done!

ok, board should be ready!

ok, kicad wont stop telling me in DRC that theres errors, since the `A3144E GPIO` isn't connected (since, connecting both GPIO to listen to the A3144 would probably end badly). im gonna have to write this down somewhere, but we have to connect those two pins!

ok, we need to update the LED ones now...

also, dont remembered if i mentioned this, but the LED pael needs updates because... a nut kinda crushes one of the LEDs, and the bottom ones might be a *little* too close to the pads (ill do the LCSC stuff later)

wait its 3:45 PM now, im gonna take a quick break... back at 4:04 PM! (not found)

since the LED panel is 99.8827mm tall, we're getting really close to the 10cm mark, so we might actually have to make the ~~RAM stick~~ LED panel a bit wider, which should, in theory, not really change the price? this quote is taking a while... yeah, still $2.10! ok gonna work on it...

LED PCB now updated! updating the cad now...
