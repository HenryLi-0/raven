# 7/4/2025 - 10th Update!

ok, starting today at 2:20 PM instead of the previous couple days! fist things first, im gonna update the PCBs!

ok, been doing some work, then just remembered that i needed to update the license (since, GNU GPL v3 is kinda a more software thing). just updated it, with `CERN-OHL-S v2` for the hardware and `GNU GPL v3` for the software! that should keep everything open source! ok, quick commit, PCB work is still being done!
