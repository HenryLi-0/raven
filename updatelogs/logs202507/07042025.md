# 7/4/2025 - 10th Update!

ok, starting today at 2:20 PM instead of the previous couple days! fist things first, im gonna update the PCBs!

ok, been doing some work, then just remembered that i needed to update the license (since, GNU GPL v3 is kinda a more software thing). just updated it, with `CERN-OHL-S v2` for the hardware and `GNU GPL v3` for the software! that should keep everything open source! ok, quick commit, PCB work is still being done!

ok, board should be ready!

ok, kicad wont stop telling me in DRC that theres errors, since the `A3144E GPIO` isn't connected (since, connecting both GPIO to listen to the A3144 would probably end badly). im gonna have to write this down somewhere, but we have to connect those two pins!

ok, we need to update the LED ones now...

also, dont remembered if i mentioned this, but the LED pael needs updates because... a nut kinda crushes one of the LEDs, and the bottom ones might be a *little* too close to the pads (ill do the LCSC stuff later)

wait its 3:45 PM now, im gonna take a quick break... back at 4:04 PM! (not found)

since the LED panel is 99.8827mm tall, we're getting really close to the 10cm mark, so we might actually have to make the ~~RAM stick~~ LED panel a bit wider, which should, in theory, not really change the price? this quote is taking a while... yeah, still $2.10! ok gonna work on it...

LED PCB now updated! updating the cad now...

ok, exported, importing into onshape! (also, quick commit)

uh why is the xiao made of solid gold now (yes, i know that its just the color, but it looked really funny)

wait i might actually need to revisit the idea of putting the boards electronics on top since... er...

![whaaa](</updatelogs/images/202507/07042025 - 4.png>)

yeah we might have a bit of a problem... yeah, mounting it on top might be the move... also, we have a LOT of collision issues

so we might have to solder the wires upside down for the main part, which is probably a smart move if we incorporate a couple zip ties, since that should keep all the wiring safe and tucked inside the machine (we dont want a flying whip of sorts) we also need to have a safety off switch, which i kinda forgot to add to the BOM, but that'll probably be ziptied somewhere too

![hmm](</updatelogs/images/202507/07042025 - 5.png>)

played around with how wire length can impact singal strength, and it seems that sus wiring that goes back and forth for very long doesnt mess with the signals *too* much, we'll have to see with the neopixels (right now, its just GPIO value determines on/off, unlike neopixels that have to send the info)

ok, its 5:06 PM and im gonna be back in a bit! as for CAD work, planning on starting to do the right side (with the batteries and chargers) now!
