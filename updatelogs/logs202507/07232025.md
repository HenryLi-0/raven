# 7/23/2025 - 28th Update!

yeah so i woke up at 8 AM, then fell asleep and woke up like three times, but now its 11:22 AM. i have like, maybe 10 minutes before i gotta eat lunch and head out, so lets make this super quick!

hunting down the `AOD424` footprint thingy (snapeda time). uh theres no symbol but there is a footprint. hmm, imma just, send a request

so it seems like the `STP55NF06L` has a similar symbol (except... is that a squiggly?) also, we have to pull down this line too (i think? saw something like that somewhere, gotta look into that), so i guess we're making symbols today?

ok, 11:36 AM now, gonna look into how to make kicad symbols (gotta go eat lunch and go outside now) (and read more of that rust book)

ok, back at 6:12 PM, just realized we have a lot of stuff to update in the journal... anyways, think im ready to try making this symbol! just gonna check if snapeda did it yet... nope, they just released some bot or something. anyways, to kicad!

woo! added made my first symbol! i think it looks pretty similar to the datasheet! couldnt figure out how to make another symbol field, but whatever, yay! now gotta figure out how to wire this... ok, so to my understanding, we shove power down the gain of the N mosfet gain, and that creates a connection between source and drain, so more power, more speed, but the capcitor stays loaded, so you have to connect the capciator to gnd, or else gate stays too open?

ok, i think i got the wiring down, i just need to recalculate the heat thing to make sure we dont get a fire

its 6:48 PM, currently trying to find what footprint i used for the 10kÎ© resistor last time, and yeah, updating the PCB! (off to dinner now!)

ok, back at 8:30 PM! so for later, im thinking about the reveal video for this (yeah theres gonna be one!). i was thinking of the background music, and i have two choices, gotta decide on it! anyways, back to kicad! im now confused on how to wire it and im watching the video again

just watched that video and [another one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1WRxmG3h3I), seems like the wiring is ok! moved around a couple resistor positions, then renamed the `A3144E` stuff to just `HALL`, PCB time!

ok, 10:26 PM, watched lots of MOSFET videos, looked at chart 1 of the datasheet a couple times, i think it looks ok? (side note: it seems that asking the omniscient ai does not work very well for this, since it cant exactly convey the information very well. its also lots of times wrong.)

also, broke symmetry on the motor power pads in order to all for more space for the MOSFET stuff, hopefully thats a good enough space? ok, added back symettry, should still function though (dont worry, mosfet still has the same amount of space!) DRC seems ok, time to do BOM! gonna actually do this in another file...

huh internet blew up again, why is it always at 10:40 PM ish, im gonna watch a movie now (its 10:48 PM now)

ok, back at 12:12 AM, seems like the internet blew up from my side (internet adapter or whatever sometimes does this i think?)

wow thats crazy, i dont have an ethernet port, and the wifi works perfectly fine! idk what the issue is but i guess this model of computers just breaks the wifi stuff side of things whenever put into sleep? ok, restarted, and we're back! BOM time!

ok, just need to find some links tomorrow, and we should be almost there! phew, cant believe its been 28 updates already... also, note to the first update log, doing three projects at once isn't a good idea since youll only end up doing one of them at a time (and its this one!)! ok, its 1 AM, i think i put a couple too many notices about the BOM being the worst possible case that could happen to you (like the theoretical max price, as in, no deals or promotions), but yeah, hopefully nothing bad happens that raises the prices (no, do not say subtle foreshadowing.)

ok, good night! (wow, i have 5 update logs for the journal...) good night!
