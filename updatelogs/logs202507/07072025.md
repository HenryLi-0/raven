# 7/7/2025 - 13th Update!

yeah its 12:52 PM and im forcrd to touch grass to earn money

turns out the middle achool has the same internet password as the other schools across NYC so it appears that i maybe can hunt for more LCSC parts

yeah so last night i fell asleep (oops) so i guess heres the summary

basically, the one i was looking at had weird funny funny, basically i had no clue what that extra characters on that text mean. also, the marking on the LED itself (like the lines) were different so i went back on LCSC and found [this thingy](https://lcsc.com/product-detail/RGB-LEDs-Built-in-IC_Worldsemi-WS2812B-B-W_C114586.html), looks pretty close to the actual thing (i have to make sire the markings match when i get back home), but it has a 5.0mm x 5.4mm, wait nvm actually the base is 5.0mm x 5.0mm, 5.4mm is just counting the pads! ok, this should be the one!

yeah its now 3:14 PM (last thing was from 1:20 ish) getting bored now (we're all done with our stuff), kinda miss my computer right now, but we'll do with what we have. 

60 of [these LED](https://lcsc.com/product-detail/RGB-LEDs-Built-in-IC_Worldsemi-WS2812B-B-W_C114586.html) (same as the ones up there) cost $3.95 (FRC 395? two train robotics?) anyways, within our budget! (wonder what shipping costs are?)

ok, i guess we have to calculate trace width at home (and figure out and **finalize** the power system), so its 3:18 PM, i need to find the bathroom in this school, so see ya!

yeah bathroom was in a very cursed spot and the bathroom itself was very cursed. anyways, its 9:15 PM at night, and i decided to do a little something for the last 15 minutes!

yeah, i also didnt expect to see the insides of my hackpad tonight, but i just decided to do a little cleaning! while it was out however, i decided to snag some data on its light spread! unfortunately, my measurements tell me that its more than 180 degrees, since it somehow lit areas below the PCB, but that's also probably since we're in a white room with a couple reflective surfaces here and there. anyways, the aforementioned LEDs seem good! anyways, finalizing the power system time!

wait research is telling me we need like 1 or 2 cm thick traces for 5V @20A... anyways, lets ignore that for now, and draw this diagram!

why does going outside make me so tired (i just laid in bed from 9:30 PM to 10 PM) ok now im being forced to sleep, i guess you get a wiring diagram tomorrow? just kidding, took like 45 minutes, but here's the drawing!
