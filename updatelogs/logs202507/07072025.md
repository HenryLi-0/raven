# 7/7/2025 - 13th Update!

yeah its 12:52 PM and im forcrd to touch grass to earn money

turns out the middle achool has the same internet password as the other schools across NYC so it appears that i maybe can hunt for more LCSC parts

yeah so last night i fell asleep (oops) so i guess heres the summary

basically, the one i was looking at had weird funny funny, basically i had no clue what that extra characters on that text mean. also, the marking on the LED itself (like the lines) were different so i went back on LCSC and found [this thingy](https://lcsc.com/product-detail/RGB-LEDs-Built-in-IC_Worldsemi-WS2812B-B-W_C114586.html), looks pretty close to the actual thing (i have to make sire the markings match when i get back home), but it has a 5.0mm x 5.4mm, wait nvm actually the base is 5.0mm x 5.0mm, 5.4mm is just counting the pads! ok, this should be the one!

yeah its now 3:14 PM (last thing was from 1:20 ish) getting bored now (we're all done with our stuff), kinda miss my computer right now, but we'll do with what we have. 

60 of [these LED](https://lcsc.com/product-detail/RGB-LEDs-Built-in-IC_Worldsemi-WS2812B-B-W_C114586.html) (same as the ones up there) cost $3.95 (FRC 395? two train robotics?) anyways, within our budget! (wonder what shipping costs are?)

ok, i guess we have to calculate trace width at home (and figure out and **finalize** the power system), so its 3:18 PM, i need to find the bathroom in this school, so see ya!
