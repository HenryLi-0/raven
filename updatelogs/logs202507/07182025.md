# 7/18/2025 - 23rd Update!

hey! its 6 PM now, kinda tired (i got a giant cut from a piece of polycarb today), but we're so so so close to finishing CAD! found 20 zipties from a random box today, so that'll probably be enough to mount the electronics

ok, just updated the PCB, why does the mounting area remind me of the Limelight 2 design

ok, its 6:30 PM, updated the CAD and stuff, just need to add a couple bolts and it should be good! after this, we go to firmware! (but dinner first)

ok, its 8:45 PM and im back (had some meeting)! turns out i did a silly, and i just realized i did more silly. basically, we removed the middle mounting holes to the straight right of the center of the led subsystem, so theres nothing there (meaning, we have to move some stuff to the side). additionally, 40mm screws are kinda way too long for these spacers (shouldve noticed this yesterday, but they dig into each other on every long spacer. oops.)

solutions? fix the arm mounting (also figure out where we put this hall effect sensor) and replace all 40mm screws with 30mm. or something. (we still need 10 40mm screws though, 4 for the motor mount, 4 for the connection to the top, and 2 for the shaft collar)

it might be smarter for me to just add the holes back onto the led subsystem, since we're gonna have to wire this hall effect sensor anyways (theres nothing non-moving for the magnet to be on, if the hall effect sensor is soldered directly onto the board)

also, just realized the center text still says "CORE PCB"

here's a before and after! (left is before, right is after)

![woo](</updatelogs/images/202507/07182025 - 1.png>)

updating that silkscreen now... so uh im trying to remember how i did this. i remember my steps, but i dont remember the settings... ok, just finished updating it! text is a bit smaller, but still is there! (all text on the PCB will probably be kinda super small)

you know, i think this is a bit obvious, but that idea from yesterday to connect the two bits? turns out thats connecting the inner motor part (doesnt move) to the outside spinning part (that does move). yeah, i really shouldve seen this one

ok, working on fixing it, currently 10:30 PM, ill be back in a bit!

back at 11:46 PM! currently going through the CAD to see how many screws each (20mm just got updated to 16mm) we need, trying to aim for multiples (or just below) of 20, since we dont want to buy a bunch of extra screws we dont end up using

also, quick side note, i do NOT remember the keycaps on the macropad being this smooth (maybe i finish hackboard now? i did finish it back in march, maybe ill redesign it)

list because paragraph form is unreadable:
- M4 40mm screws
    - $\frac{6.395683}{0.639568}$
    - 10 screws
- M4 30mm screws
    - $\frac{12.33371}{0.513905}$
    - 24 screws
- M4 16mm screws
    - $\frac{28.389932}{0.337975}$
    - 84 screws

yeah so while calulating the screw counts, M4 16mm screws had a suspicious decimal. turns out a couple M4 30mm screws snuck into that folder. anyways, those are very sad not multiples of 20. ideally, it seems that the fastest solution is turning 4x 16mm screws into 40mm, and 4x 30mm screws into 40mm. 

yeah i dont know which screws to change out. but on a side note, just fixed a couple spacer issues!

im gonna write up a quick essay on what everything is so far, so we get a general idea of what this is! (its probably gonna sound so robotic)

i just realized the journal has the wrong project on it. whoops.

Introducing Raven, an open source spinning LED light display! The system can be seperated into three parts: the motor subsystem, the LED control subsystem, and the LED panels. But first, what exactly is the idea behind Raven? Inspired by the light effects done at BattleCry 2025 at WPI (2025BC), along with really liking LEDs for some reason, I wanted to create a LED display that lights up an entire room. But a stationary system wouldn't create the desired effect, the effect to slice up the room into different colors. For example, imagine the left side of the room being red and the right being blue.

This is accomplished by having 5 LED panels, each with 10 LEDs each, vertically stacked, pointing outwards. These 5 panels form a 180 degree circle, each panel spaced 45 degrees off the next. Arms connecting to the top and bottom of the LED panels attach to a center. Spacers keep these top and bottom arms in position. In the center, the top arms connect to the LED control PCB, which contains a XIAO ESP32-C3. This board is also equipped with a Hall Effect Sensor, used to be a simple way to measure RPM without an expensive encoder. This entire section spins on a shaft collar connected to a 775 motor. Additionally, a 18650 Li-ion battery is on this section, powering the whole thing without need for a power wire.

In order to save on costs, a slip ring was strongly avoided during design. Instead, the motor subsystem powers the motor with 4 Li-ion batteries, supplying a total of 14.8-16.8V @20A to the motor. 4 Li-ion batteries was choosen as a solution to the problem with finding suitable boost converters, which were either incapable of handling 20A, or are just really expensive. In fact, it is actually cheaper to use 4 Li-ion batteries than a single one of these boost converters. This solution also gave the benefit of having additional battery time, which was a nice side bonus. The motor subsystem is stationary, with the base being a copy of the LED control subsystem's PCB. This empty PCB is used as the FR-4 material of the PCB is likely stronger than PLA parts, while also being a smart way to reuse the multiple PCBs sent by JLCPCB. This is also the reason why there are 5 LED panels, as to minimize waste. The motor subsystem is also powered with a XIAO ESP32-C3, and has its own Hall Effect Sensor to measure the RPM of the LED subsystem.

The control system starts at the stationary motor subsystem microcontroller, which sends a constant ping to the LED subsystem's microcontroller. The LED subsystem reads this ping through the ESP32's bluetooth capabilities, and also sends a ping back. Both systems need to listen to each other in order to think they are operating properly. In the event that a ping isn't heard in a long time, the LED subsystem will stop operating and the motor subsystem will attempt to bring the motor to a stop. While operating properly, the LED subsystem uses a mix of data from the motor subsystem's Hall Effect Sensor and the LED subsystem's Hall Effect Sensor to calculate its speed and position, utilizing a model of the motor's speed. The motor subsystem will use PID control with a MOSFET to ensure that the LED subsystem reaches the proper spin.

This entire system is packaged inside a cylinderical shape with diameter of roughly 24 cm and a height of roughly 15 cm. The LED subsystem, weighing less than 2 pounds, plans to spin at anywhere from 1k-2k RPM, in order to achieve a speed where the LEDs essentially blend into a blur. The LED subsytem is loaded with almost 120 screws, in order to ensure that the LED subsystem stays in place. Additionally, all batteries are protected inside an over-discharge protection board and charged with a TP4056 module with protection (the TP4056 does NOT provide power to the system, it is only used for charging.).

And that's Raven, an open source spinning light display!

that took 20 minutes... i think i touched on all the points? ok, gonna write a quick checklist of things we need to test before actual trusting it!

Post-Build Test Checklist:
- Mechanical
    - All screws tightened, loctite applied (or other things)
    - No bends anywhere (especially the arms)
    - Shaft can spin freely by hand without power
    - All wires secured
    - Battery securely mounted
- Initial test (100-200 RPM)
    - Powered on in a safe enclosure
    - System can spin without wobble/vibration
    - No expensive noises
    - Hall Effect Senssors read the correct RPM
    - Failsafes work properly (with simulated ping loss)
    - Tuned motor PID controller

    - Check any logs
    - Check all wires, boards, and solder joints
- Endurance test
    - Aim for 3 days of total running with no issues
    - Several cycles per day, at different speeds
    - Check temperatures and operation for all cycles
    - Save logs
    - Look at logs for any strange stuff!

ok, its 1 AM now, good night! so we just have to assume a BOM, change some screws, and yeah! also, quick note, might want to make the spacers have smaller holes near the ends in order to force the screws to grab onto the spacer (so that it, you know, actually does something) but yeah, that and some firmware! (probably better to have it, but whatever, we'll make a through editor sometime in the future!)

ok, good night! (uh oh gotta update journal for a lot of days...)
