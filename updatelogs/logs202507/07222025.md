# 7/22/2025 - 27th Update!

idk why are started reading the rust book. but looks pretty interesting, its like python, java, and javascript made a new language together, but this language is kinda on something (read the first three chapters, probably gonna re-read it, guess that another thing for this summer). anyways, found an overdischarge protection thing today too! just gotta move the link over (havent looked over the specs just yet). also, last night, i also started reading some art book. (huh maybe i should start reading some of my summer reading book)

also, ill REALLY try, but hopefully if we finish fast enough, i have time to draw some banner art (i have silly idea). anyways, 5:07 PM, here in NYC, time to get started!

[here](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256806283248236.html) it is! (choose 4S 20A Standard). unfortunately, its kinda super sketchy (not too too many buyers, also specs seem a little suboptimal)

ok its 5:48 PM now and im gonna be right back. so its 5:54 PM, and im back, so i just licked a couple crumbs of a snack off my table, then remembered this is the same table i left little microplastics on, soldered on, accidentally dripped super glue on, and opened some cursed keyboard on. yeah, might not have been my best move. anyways, back to aliexpress

hmm [heres](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256806720463818.html) another one (why do the links look so similar) (choose 4S 20A Standard)! i do not understand what this chart is saying. seems good though, not sure how 20A fits on those traces, but reviews and reviews look real!

ok, gonna check that CAD is good, gotta figure out the MOSFET thing, then BOM!

just updated some mates being a tiny bit off, should be centered now!

ok, CAD looks good! also, last night, i had an idea, what if we use like those little adapter or whatever they're called, but the things that you screw that squish a wire and creates a connection? i think its called a set screw terminal? soldering is probably ok, not gonna lie

ok, electronics updated, its 7:08 PM, im going off to dinner, gonna think about the MOSFET stuff!

back at 9:46 PM, time to look at MOSFETs again! gonna double check on the `IRLZ8721PBF` datasheet again, yep probably not. turns out digikey has a nice thing that says "Drive Voltage (Max Rds On, Min Rds On)".

i am now in a [reddit rabbit hole](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskElectronics/comments/13n50i8/help_choosing_the_right_mosfets/)

ive found the [digikey](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/filter/transistors/fets-mosfets/single-fets-mosfets/278?s=N4IgjCBcpgnLBmKoDGUBmBDANgZwKYA0IA9lANogAsAHPEsQKyM2OwjEBsYVsVH4BACYENfgF1iABwAuUEAGUZAJwCWAOwDmIAL7EAtBGgg0kLHiKkKIAOysQ4nU6A)

thank you digikey!

what is texas instruments doing, just searched up `CSD25310Q2T` and theres no way that 0.2cm x 0.2cm thing handles 20A. anyways, that would be quite the pain to solder on. ok, gotta keep search, filters might be too small

ok, played around with the filters a bit more, [here's](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/filter/transistors/fets-mosfets/single-fets-mosfets/278?s=N4IgjCBcoGwAwA4qgMZQGYEMA2BnApgDQgD2UA2uACwBMcMAzCMWAKxtVzPisKc3cwMVgxoQWwhlVaCEDVnVlgqVJCwQIwATi4stDBDTXh9crdxoMA7FZEWqDYVXuPW54jVYwYijz6ta4iA0VghWKhb63sY0WlpuQVaIDOYAusQADgAuUCAAylkATgCWAHYA5iAAvnr6yCBokFh4RKQUIFQ6YMaqcUzEnXDa3INi3AY27iAT4dysvKzOxKzJCFMwyiHcG1SzxDvs28paSyByYFYbR50wIOkg2bkFJRXVHvRI0A0YOATEZJBKEIAAQANVkYMEWkh7xhwVYcKMcIYcDhnDhKwxCPB%2B1ROJAtjh2jxFjgJPuj0gIAAqqVilkAPLoACy%2BEwuAAroV8NUqlUgA) the new search!

im just gonna make a list at this point (so many of these arent available on LCSC)

- [AOS AOD424](https://lcsc.com/datasheet/lcsc_datasheet_2410121845_AOS-AOD424_C357852.pdf)

i think i mightve just found the one! the [AOS AOD424](https://lcsc.com/datasheet/lcsc_datasheet_2410121845_AOS-AOD424_C357852.pdf), with specs of:
- 20V N-Channel MOSFET
- VDS 20V, ID (at VGS=4.5V) 45A
- RDS(ON) (at VGS=4.5V) < 4.4mΩ
- RDS(ON) (at VGS=2.5V) < 5.7mΩ
- Drive Voltage (Max Rds On, Min Rds On) 2.5V, 4.5V
- Rds On (Max) @ Id Vgs 4.4mOhm @ 20A 4.5V

[here's](https://lcsc.com/product-detail/MOSFETs_AOS-AOD424_C357852.html) the page! ok, so it seems to able to be driven at 3.3V? if VGS=4.5V allows 45A nicely, then 3.3V should be able to fit 20A? 

ok, being told to go to sleep already (its 12 AM), guess ill try to wake up earlier and finish the electronic tomorrow? glad the MOSFET situation is ok now? (we need a heatsink though)

ok, good night!
