# 7/24/2025 - 29th Update!

ok, 11:49 AM right now! last night i remembered something about flyback diodes, so imma look into that in a bit. also, i forgot to add magnets to the BOM... wait is copper magnetic? oh ok it isnt, gotta double check that out crews and nuts arent magnetic either... so the screws are magentic (they arent magnets, they would just be attracted to them if brought near though) and the nuts shouldnt be. thats alright, just gotta position these things well (depends on when we actually get these parts!)

well, i went to lunch after that at 12:00 PM...

back at the 5:55 PM timing circuit (get it the 555 timing circuit, anyways), gonna watch a couple videoes.. big thanks to [this](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/AZIxAX7fGqk) video for speedy info, and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6R_3jHeimiE) video for more deeper stuff!

wait, just remembered that i wanted to calculate the tangental velocity or whatever its called in the even that an LED or something detaches and flies off... so for a 2k RPM at 12.5cm radius, we have a tangential velocity of 26-ish m/s, according to this calculator, or 58.6-ish mph. 1000 rpm does 13-ish m/s, or 29-ish mph. ok, so theoretically not too bad if it hits (well, an LED, if the entire 2-ish pound disc slammed into your face, you probably wont feel so good). still gonna first test this from a different room lol

anyways, back to looking at flyback diodes! hate to sound like one of those youtube bot comments, but the second video really pulled the whole idea together (i recommend if you're also doing a motor mosfet setup thingy). anyways, time to implement it! (java reference?) (java reference reference?)

wait i just did a big silly, i did not need to leave that much clearance since the top of the board is the bottom on the actual thing.

this might be one of the most cursed things ive done in a while but ok, we're gonna have to mark which ways the diodes are supposed to go. its 6:48 PM, off to dinner!

8:00 PM and back, just had an idea for a bit more vanity on the PCB! actual, on second thought, probably not too good of an idea, lots of it gets clipped by the pads! gotta update the position of a couple stuff since screws are coming way too close for comfort for some of them

there it is! moved the MOSFET a bit more to the right, (also probably a good idea anyways, since it makes things a bit closer), broke the symettry of the motor pads, but its fine ("close enough"). wait, if we move the vanity (i really dont wanna do this), we could theoretically get better traces (i really dont want a fire/overheating issues you see) on the `MOTOR-`... yeah i guess its a good idea for performance.

currently 8:47 PM, adding a bit of silkscreen art for fun

moved the motor trace to be more straight (should hopefully not create excess heat), shifted the bottom text to the middle (still looks good!), and added some art

ok back to BOM time! gonna do a quick commit first...
