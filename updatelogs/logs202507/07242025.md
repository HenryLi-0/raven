# 7/24/2025 - 29th Update!

ok, 11:49 AM right now! last night i remembered something about flyback diodes, so imma look into that in a bit. also, i forgot to add magnets to the BOM... wait is copper magnetic? oh ok it isnt, gotta double check that out crews and nuts arent magnetic either... so the screws are magentic (they arent magnets, they would just be attracted to them if brought near though) and the nuts shouldnt be. thats alright, just gotta position these things well (depends on when we actually get these parts!)

well, i went to lunch after that at 12:00 PM...

back at the 5:55 PM timing circuit (get it the 555 timing circuit, anyways), gonna watch a couple videoes.. big thanks to [this](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/AZIxAX7fGqk) video for speedy info, and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6R_3jHeimiE) video for more deeper stuff!

wait, just remembered that i wanted to calculate the tangental velocity or whatever its called in the even that an LED or something detaches and flies off... so for a 2k RPM at 12.5cm radius, we have a tangential velocity of 26-ish m/s, according to this calculator, or 58.6-ish mph. 1000 rpm does 13-ish m/s, or 29-ish mph. ok, so theoretically not too bad if it hits (well, an LED, if the entire 2-ish pound disc slammed into your face, you probably wont feel so good). still gonna first test this from a different room lol

anyways, back to looking at flyback diodes! hate to sound like one of those youtube bot comments, but the second video really pulled the whole idea together (i recommend if you're also doing a motor mosfet setup thingy). anyways, time to implement it! (java reference?) (java reference reference?)

wait i just did a big silly, i did not need to leave that much clearance since the top of the board is the bottom on the actual thing.

this might be one of the most cursed things ive done in a while but ok, we're gonna have to mark which ways the diodes are supposed to go. its 6:48 PM, off to dinner!

8:00 PM and back, just had an idea for a bit more vanity on the PCB! actual, on second thought, probably not too good of an idea, lots of it gets clipped by the pads! gotta update the position of a couple stuff since screws are coming way too close for comfort for some of them

![woo](</updatelogs/images/202507/07242025 - 1.png>)

there it is! moved the MOSFET a bit more to the right, (also probably a good idea anyways, since it makes things a bit closer), broke the symettry of the motor pads, but its fine ("close enough"). wait, if we move the vanity (i really dont wanna do this), we could theoretically get better traces (i really dont want a fire/overheating issues you see) on the `MOTOR-`... yeah i guess its a good idea for performance.

currently 8:47 PM, adding a bit of silkscreen art for fun

![owo](</updatelogs/images/202507/07242025 - 2.png>)

moved the motor trace to be more straight (should hopefully not create excess heat), shifted the bottom text to the middle (still looks good!), and added some art

ok back to BOM time! gonna do a quick commit first...

mfw i remember i have 5 or 6 journal updates to do

$9 shipping is crazy

i can not find these resistors. oh, turns out only 2 are in stock for the ones im looking for (i guess its way too specific?) the `Through Hole,D9xL36.5mm` package is crazy. ok, 10W is NOT flowing through this (as in, our load will not need that much), so we do NOT need these mega sized resistors

ok, found some better resistors (cheaper too!), this time not gigantic. its rated for 1W, which should be more than enough headroom. they might be a bit small for the PCB, but it should be fine? now, time to find some diodes for the xiao...

ok, sent them a help quesiton about it (imo the docs are a bit confusing on this), trying to understand what it means (cant be too careful), got hit with this:

![huh](</updatelogs/images/202507/07242025 - 3.png>)

spoiler: i cant really read chinese. i do know what the last character is (i know like a few characters from years ago), but all i know is that its likely a question. which doesnt help because theres already question marks. (luckily, these days we can just translate this, no, i did not give my phone number)

reading the [docs](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/XIAO_ESP32C3_Pin_Multiplexing/#note-on-xiao-esp32c3-io-allocation), turns out that pin D6 gets possesed by a demon on boot up, so im just gonna change a couple traces real quick... ok, updated now! backup pin has been moved to D6!

just looked at some [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymW2C0BO0eQ) with the XIAO ESP32-C3, cool thing, but im just here to note how you're wiring it. seems like it got it ok? just need to find a diode! oh its 10:47 PM and the internet blew up again. oh its back now.

ok, 10:51 PM, brb! ok so its 12:00 AM now. i have no idea what these parameters mean. (i mean, a guess, sure, but never heard of some of these parameters) ok, got a couple `1N5819` for the XIAO, should be rated well for this use case! shipping is terrifying, on the other hand.

we forgot the boost converters. ok, so for the LEDs , we need something that goes 3.7-4.2V -> 5V, and for the motor, something that goes 14.8-16.8V -> 5V (i should update the PCB info, it is NOT 12V.). so one step down, one step up.

ok, just updated the PCB!

hmm 60mA*50 LEDs, worst case, 3000 mA, which is 3A, yeah 2A isnt enough... found [one](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256805963034065.html) for step down, not yet for step up... the reviews on [this](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/2261799814341528.html) one is super sus.

we also forgot TP4056 modules oops

looked in the `updatelogs` or `JOURNAL.md` and found a link to [this](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/2255800011462620.html) step up! limited to 5A on either end if im reading this right, some math tells me that 5V 4A on load worst case means 4.2V @4.7A and 3.7V @5.4A. eh, from what i can tell from WS2812Bs is that they dont seem to gobble up too much power (we arent setting the LEDs to pure white all the way round... maybe a future test though), so it should be fine!

i just noticed the little text under the big price that says $0.17 in extra taxes. uh i didnt account for that... i should really put all the stuff in a cart and actually see what aliexpress says.

uh we really are hitting the roof (as in, self imposed $150 limit) here.

ok, we're nearing 1AM now! ignore the little edit in the `README.md`, nothing to see here... (yay cant wait to calculate times for 6 `updatelogs` tomorrow...) anyways, going to school tomorrow, hopefully gonna finally clean stuff up by the end of tomorrow! (so finish BOM, calculate times, update CAD, and polish things up!)

what is this. (random pop up)

![wha](</updatelogs/images/202507/07242025 - 4.png>)

gonna investigate this, but, for now, good night!
