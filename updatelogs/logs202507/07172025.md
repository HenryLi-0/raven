# 7/17/2025 - 22nd Update!

oops its 9:17 PM, adding nuts now (yep getting straight to work) (wait im gonna import the PCBs into onshape first)

onshape is very sad and slow when importing these pcbs...

huh onshapes geting a little faster?

ok, holes cadded, that took surprisingly long to import, time to add the nuts!

no way, square nuts are a thing?

![woa](</updatelogs/images/202507/07172025 - 1.png>)

so turns out i should make it 0.82mm spacing or something (greater than 0.808) instead of 0.7mm spacing. whoops. also, wow, that means that these screws and nuts are SMALL! anyways, 10:24 PM now, most nuts added, just gotta update the spacing of lots of stuff... (benefits of parametric cad!)

wait im gonna go watch a movie (its 10:45 PM right now)

its now 12:12 AM. before i went to watch a movie, i updated a couple of the spacings of stuff, so now its time to update the cad. again! ok, exporting from kicad now... ok, importing into onshape now... ok, onshape doing its thing now...

why is it `-0.790000` cm instead of `0.8`. ok, silly mistake fixed, importing again...

ok, updated the collar shaft! ok, screws updated, assembly repaired, doing some final checks now!

ok, CAD looks good! just a little note, seems like the holes on the PCB can be a bit further away from each other! might actually connect the inner vertical screws on the lower motor support plate to the ones on the motor top mount... (i will need to steal 4 screws from somewhere)

oh i actually just found where! the 4 screws we have for the outer spacers for one of the arms are kinda unnecessarily long (they literally collide with each other) so i guess we replace those with some shorter screws

ok its 1am now and im going up to school tomorrow, so i guess im finishing this tomorrow? (please)

here's the current state of things! (currently doing the changes with the mounting, so thats why theres a couple missing screws and nuts on the lower motor support plate)

ok, good night!
