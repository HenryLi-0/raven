# 7/25/2025 - 30th Update!

update 30! started at like 4:45 PM, and just updated all the journals! if i put in those numbers correctly, i've spent 96.75 hours on this so far (thats actually insane!). hopefully today's the last day, since it's been, quite literally a month since we started! (6/25/2025 was the first update log!)

stuff to do:
- complete BOM!
    - add stuff
        - wiring
        - magnets (maybe? check LCSC first)
        - solder? (maybe? might run out, gotta make sure its safe)
    - aliexpress and orders
    - figure out shipping prices and deals!
- double check PCB wiring
    - (for all!)
- update CAD
    - with most updated PCBs
    - double check collisions again
- clean up repository
    - double check docs
    - update journal
    - finish [the main `README.md`](</README.md>)
- submit
    - ??? (check the website again)

ok, time to get going! as in, start working on stuff, im not leaving just yet! little note to anyone looking for AWG numbers, there's a [great chart on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_wire_gauge)! for example, here, 12AWG supports 20A at 60C! 22AWG supports 3A at 60C! ok, so now we got our wires!

yeah so i actually just touched my bed at 5:30 PM, and then just... fell asleep? did a couple other things, back at 8:47 PM! ok, so BOM stuff, need some 12AWG wire, got some!

ok, gonna try optimizing the BOM now (we're reaaaaaly hitting the roof now), quick commit first!
