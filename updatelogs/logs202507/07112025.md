# 7/11/2025 - 17th Update!

ok its 9:55 PM, and i just finished updating the journal with the last three days! i feel like we're really dragging things out, not intentionally of course, but things really should be faster. looking back, i think a good thing we should do is create a couple goals and deadlines, so that we dont keep going on forever! ideally, it should be 100% complete by 7/15/2025, as far as the digital designs. materials then should come around the end of july, then can be constructed across maybe two days, then finally complete! of course, assuming everything arrives on time...

ok, so here's the deal!
- 7/11/2025
    - finalize any electronics
    - start working on the LED subsystem PCB
- 7/12/2025
    - finish working on the LED subsystem PCB
    - start working on the motor subsystem PCB
    - finish working on the motor subsystem PCB
- 7/13/2025
    - fix any PCB issues
    - complete BOM list
    - start finishing the CAD
- 7/14/2025
    - finish the CAD
    - prepare for release!
- 7/15/2025
    - release!
    - (if you see this on 7/15/2025, i guess henry actually did it on time!)

so yeah, we got a plan, lets (hopefully) do it on time! woah, just got a flashback, wow, i miss hack club's arcade event... dont worry, summer of making is gonna be the next thing i work on after this!

ok, electronics diagram now! its 10:04 PM, and i guess lets aim to be done by 10:15 PM! do i add a speaker now... its 10:20 PM and yeah, drawing these diagrams to look good is pretty hard... yeah we're not adding a speaker, its probably gonna take like two more days to research it? need some amplifier or something

ok, its 10:29 PM, and i thinkk its ok! the only issue is that we dont exactly have a 4S 20A over discharge protection module thing, so we cant exactly connect that, but we'll do that later! ok, picutre incoming any second now...

yeah, so we gotta go fast, before i start to grind on mosim, speaking of which, heres why LEDs are great!

yep, we got some drive team practice today! also got the robot up and running again, so that nice! anyways, LOOK AT THOSE LEDS! LOOK AT THAT GLOW! (why are there like 5 or 6 LEDs off at the end... probably a code thing) anyways, back to the PCB! yeah i guess we just keep the core PCB around for now for reference! ok, quick commit!
