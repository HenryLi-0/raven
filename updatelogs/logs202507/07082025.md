# 7/8/2025 - 14th Update!

no way its taking this long, lets finish this! so, its 6PM right now (started updating the journals at 5:45 PM)! realized that yesterday's diagram isnt *super* clear (as in, image quality, its a little blurry), so here's a better image!

![diagram!](</updatelogs/images/202507/07082025 - 1.png>)

ok, first thing, lemme double check that the MT3608 can actually support our amperage (and volts too), so lets do some math... ok, so if we can support 3.7-4.2V @20A, we can do 5V @14.8-16.8A, which is ok? also, for the motor, if we need, we can run it at 14V @5.29-6A (lower limit is roughly 5.28571A), which should be able to power the 775 motor? it might actually be ok for this! (we're feeding a total of 74-84W)

ok, just ran through this idea with an omniscient ai, and it says its pretty much ok, just have a shared ground for everything and the buck convertors, so yeah, thats what im gonna do! well, after dinner, its 6:30 right now!

ok, back, its 7:45 PM now! i guess its time to do the PCB stuff? gonna calculate the width of the traces real quick...uh 2.5cm traces is kinda crazy, lemme double check that... uh yeah.

ok, so since we cant have giant fat 2cm traces on our PCB, we're gonna have to do something different. uh. so we kinda need to "banish" a couple amps on the logic side... wait a second, does the battery only supply whats needed? oh. oopsie, i guess we dont need 2cm traces on our PCB! (except for the motor...) ok, PCB time now! im gonna estimate the logic line needs 5A at most (probably only 3A at most, realistically, but lets just do 5A to be safe), so, according to kicad, with a current of `5A` and temperature rise of `10C`, we need `2.76552mm` traces (round to `2.8mm`, just to be safe). meanwhile, for `20A` and temperature rise of `10C`, we need `18.7156mm` traces (round to `20mm`, just to be safe). ok, time to get to work!

hmm... how to change the entire net... did it manually, LED panel's almost good! just gonna change the pad size...

![waw](</updatelogs/images/202507/07082025 - 2.png>)

ok, 8:50 PM, led panel done! now for the big PCB... (also those traces are MASSIVE) yeah, we also need to do the thing with the shared ground... yeah so this is kinda confusing... wait im gonna quickly commit the led stuff

oh yeah we should also look to source our diodes from LCSC

ok, back (took a rest from 9PM to 9:30PM), yeah these nets are absolutely messed up... really considering redoing it? how am i supposed to route the pins of the MOSFET when the traces are 2cm thick... yeah so if we shove 20A in a 0.8mm trace, we get some sweet 1800C temperature rise (aka, we start dealing with liquid copper)

ok, you know what, i guess we'll let it rise `15C`, and just print some fan blades to stick onto this (since, this thing is essentially a giant fan), bringing out traces to `14.6331mm` wide, rounded to `15mm`

wait im gonna find the datasheet or data of the motor to find out how many amps we should actually aim for

need to do some math, so if each LED is 5mm apart, and say, a 25cm diamter, we have a roughly 158 LED long circle (assuming the LEDs fit the circle perfectly, which they dont), anyways, what was i calculating again? we need to do a full revolution every "refresh" of the eye, so thats like 50 rotations per second? so like 3k rotations per minute?

wait im a little silly. oops. so uh, basically, since we're running it at 14V, we actually **ARENT** shoving 20A down the line, we actually are doing 5-6A, so we actually only need `4.39879mm` traces (calculated for `7A`, rounded to `4.4mm`). yeah sorry, that was a big waste of time... ok, looking for motors (original one is kinda... lacking documentation), andymark has terrifying shipping prices

wait im actually kinda confused because 14V @5-6A is, in fact, **NOT** enough for this motor... im gonna stop doing the PCB design for now, gonna focus on what motor we're using. ok, just spent a bit look at [some 550 motors](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256805434004883.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.main.2.38ad10dbozbJho&algo_pvid=c85af6f1-91bd-4d8b-9026-3312fcf9b4de&algo_exp_id=c85af6f1-91bd-4d8b-9026-3312fcf9b4de-1&pdp_ext_f=%7B%22order%22%3A%22476%22%2C%22eval%22%3A%221%22%7D&pdp_npi=4%40dis%21USD%213.63%210.99%21%21%2125.92%217.06%21%40210318e817520322585382672ea633%2112000033773483986%21sea%21US%216405565024%21ABX&curPageLogUid=eMsbf9qdwhwJ&utparam-url=scene%3Asearch%7Cquery_from%3A) and i *think* they aren't strong enough? i guess we just stick with our original motor and try to figure stuff out?

looking back, a `1S 24A` BMS makes kinda no sense for the 20A max discharge battery, gotta fix that too. guess we going for `1S 16A` then! ok, talking to omniscient ai, i just got insulted, so i guess 775 isn't the way to go? so the 775 is an inrunner motor but we're looking for an outrunner motor. however, that setup would require us to have a slipring since the mosfet is still in the spinning bit, so thats kinda out of the question. also, the boost convertor does 2A max so we need to find another one

ok so its 12:30 AM right now, and ive think ive accepted the fact that we cant do this do a 775 motor, we have to use an outrunner motor. however, that requires us to move the entire motor control circuitry off the spinning board and onto a new board that stays stationary with respect to the table. this means we have two microcontrollers, one in the spinning bit for LED control and one at the base for motor control. they *should* communicate when to power on and off via bluetooth!

something something esc, honestly, im a bit too tired tonight, so i guess ill continue looking into this tomorrow!

good night! (12:50 AM woo)

ok so its like 2:31 AM and ive been looking at memes for like an hour (i should stop), but realized im the buggest silly in the seven seas right now. we dont need a drone motor or an outrunner motor. we just need to flip the 775 motor upside down so that the shaft touches the spinny bit and spins with it, and is normally mounted onto the bit that doesnt spin. then, we have to have the two microcontroller setup, but this time we can actually use PWM and our MOSFET idea/setup (instead of a whole ESC setup for drone motors and whatever). this does mean we need like a giant clearance between the motor (like the big part) and the lower PCB, but i guess we could just print the bottom and just have a top PCB if we have to. anyways, this also gives us more space for the motor PCB and its wiring, so thats nice! ok good night!
