# 7/8/2025 - 14th Update!

no way its taking this long, lets finish this! so, its 6PM right now (started updating the journals at 5:45 PM)! realized that yesterday's diagram isnt *super* clear (as in, image quality, its a little blurry), so here's a better image!

ok, first thing, lemme double check that the MT3608 can actually support our amperage (and volts too), so lets do some math... ok, so if we can support 3.7-4.2V @20A, we can do 5V @14.8-16.8A, which is ok? also, for the motor, if we need, we can run it at 14V @5.29-6A (lower limit is roughly 5.28571A), which should be able to power the 775 motor? it might actually be ok for this! (we're feeding a total of 74-84W)

ok, just ran through this idea with an omniscient ai, and it says its pretty much ok, just have a shared ground for everything and the buck convertors, so yeah, thats what im gonna do! well, after dinner, its 6:30 right now!

ok, back, its 7:45 PM now! i guess its time to do the PCB stuff? gonna calculate the width of the traces real quick...uh 2.5cm traces is kinda crazy, lemme double check that... uh yeah.

ok, so since we cant have giant fat 2cm traces on our PCB, we're gonna have to do something different. uh. so we kinda need to "banish" a couple amps on the logic side... wait a second, does the battery only supply whats needed? oh. oopsie, i guess we dont need 2cm traces on our PCB! (except for the motor...) ok, PCB time now! im gonna estimate the logic line needs 5A at most (probably only 3A at most, realistically, but lets just do 5A to be safe), so, according to kicad, with a current of `5A` and temperature rise of `10C`, we need `2.76552mm` traces (round to `2.8mm`, just to be safe). meanwhile, for `20A` and temperature rise of `10C`, we need `18.7156mm` traces (round to `20mm`, just to be safe). ok, time to get to work!

hmm... how to change the entire net... did it manually, LED panel's almost good! just gonna change the pad size...

ok, 8:50 PM, led panel done! now for the big PCB... (also those traces are MASSIVE) yeah, we also need to do the thing with the shared ground... yeah so this is kinda confusing... wait im gonna quickly commit the led stuff
