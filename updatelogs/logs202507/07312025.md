# 7/31/2025 - 36th Update!

well, really not much happened today, the batteries seem to have slowed down movement, but the microcontrollers are coming in fast! that's pretty cool because i can sort out the bluetooth stuff before everything else arrives, which would be pretty cool! anyways, mosfet and pcb are still out there somewhere, doesnt seem to have moved much.

something interesting is the fact that all the aliexpress products moved to shipping. like what is this lol

talk about spam... (joking, thanks for all the updates!)

anyways, just waiting for them all to come now. estimates say roughly by august 12th or something, so yeah, i guess we can expect everything to come by two or three weeks.

in the meantime, i kinda started one of the most, if not the most, complex programming projects! it, in theory, should work, and if it does work, it would be a pretty big deal for FRC! so yeah, a lot of work to do, hopefully can write everything up before kickoff! (this stuff could also be applied to general robotics too)

anyways, yeah! thats really it for today! 30/31 updatelogs for july is pretty neat! (wow its already august?) gonna be going up to school tomorrow, so i probably wont be doing a bunch here except for maybe shipping updates and whenever those microcontrollers come, so that's it for a bit! (they're currently in NYC, likely gonna be shipped tomorrow!)

good night!
