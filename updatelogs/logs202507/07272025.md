# 7/27/2025 - 32nd Update!

surprise! didnt expect to see this huh? well, not really much today. basically, spent my morning looking through everything again, updating stuff, added another battery holder to the BOM (for the charger), compressed some stuff, and really just working on submitting and fixing stuff. overall, not too much work today, just a bunch of checking!

but yeah, havent really done anything for the rest of today (i guess thats what happens when you spend 107 hours on something and now are "done"), so yeah, pretty sort update today, good night!
