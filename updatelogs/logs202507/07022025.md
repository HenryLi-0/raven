# 7/2/2025 - 8th Update!

yeah this CAD really shouldve been done 2 days ago...

so its now 9:43 PM today (wait this feels a litle familiar), so lets get CADing! i was thinking about moving the PCB wit all the core stuff from the bottom to the top, but throught that this would expose the electronics a bit too much, and it might not have the stability that mounting it directly the the front would give. also, for now, the LED panels also serve as protection from when any electronics in the main board ever flies out (please no). basically, i will need a lot of filament for this one...

i just had an idea, what if we added a thing called a speaker directly into the thing? nah thats actually probably a bad idea if we're using the xiao (since, we dont exactly have lots of extra pins) also, just realized that the way we setup redundancy for the MOSFET and the sensor is probably a bad idea (for the MOSFET, both are set to OUT, meaning we could have issues, gotta add some diodes...) i'll fix that later!

ok just got jumpscared that we might not be able to trigger the STP55NF06L with the XIAO, but after sneaking around the internet, i found a [datasheet](https://www.st.com/resource/en/datasheet/stp55nf06l.pdf), and it looks like we'll probably be ok! ok back to cad

ok why did yesterday's windows update steal 21 GB (mfw windows keeps spamming me with updates and install four apps of bloatware on my device including one that probably has some vulnerability that'll show up in like a month that allows it to take over peoples computers) (ok now who used 0.1 GB from the last time i looked at that screen. yeah i see you, 20.6 GB to 20.5 GB...) (WHYS IT AT 20.1 GB NOW) ok im gonna install this update and try to fix my computer

hey peeps at microsoft, small request, please stop filling my computer with random intern slop! i really dont need to be forced to have copilot or whatever this new phone UI next to my start menu is. also, please stop messing around with my desktop icons! thanks. also please give my 20 GB back. thanks! back to CAD...

ok its been 20 minutes and i think i found the issue, hopefully not bad happens when i tell windows to delete previous windows installation data... something funny... the internet just broke. i guess thats the one time onshape isnt the best cad tool! oh nvm its back now

ok so we might need some caster wheels or something for the spinning bits, since idk how a short metal shaft with 0.35 cm of clearance likes having a whole spinning system mounted on top of it, but ill just add spaces to attach on future wheels if necessary (ill probably just make them out of PLA or something)

wait a second we kinda need more clearance

ok more clearance get

ok so ive been trying to do this CAD in a way that the printed parts dont like snap from centrifigal or whatever force (basically, spin at super speed, outward things fly), so ive had an idea! the PCB is basically solid copper, so we dont have to worry about that too much (yeah, try snapping one in half with your hands (or maybe dont)). its also in the center, so it doesnt experience too much, we just have to make sure we solder our connections well!

so its been like 10 minutes, and i just realized this idea isnt perfect, so im gonna keep paying around with configs

actually yeah, this idea does really work at all, either something can break or something is weirdly/impossibly mounted, ive ran through like 3 configs already

WAIT! THE SOLUTION IS JUST KISS (KEEP IT SIMPLE, SILLY!)! THE SOLUTION IS JUST A BRACKET WITH OPPOSING SUPPORTS THAT HAS SPACERS!

![what is that](</updatelogs/images/202507/07022025 - 1.png>)

so, what are you even looking at? yeah, probably shouldnt have drawn it with pen, but it was first thing i could grab, so so be it. basically, you can see the bracket there, with the clean surface being the on point bottom right (clean surface, as in, the face that isnt covered with layer lines). then we have these four other "caps" that wrap around the bracket, with the clean surface facing up. then, we have a spacer that's just solid PLA that goes on the bases of each screw, with the clean surface being the surface that, when you look at top down, you see the screw hole. then, we can wrap this around the sides, allowing us to make sure the "caps" dont move. (we can also just super glue just to be super sure!) and thats the solution! the screws then go in, and it stays! nice! ok, time to CAD this! (wow, that was a lot of thinking...)

yeah i guess i gotta CAD this upside down, we're actually kinda getting really high in the air already...

ok, being forced to go to sleep again (but its only 12:30 AM???), so here's the CAD update!

anyways, that's it! hopefully more progress tomorrow, but yeah, gotta update the PCB too! (maybe i wake up early tomorrow and grind? idk)
