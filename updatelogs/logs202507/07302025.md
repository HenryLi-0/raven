# 7/30/2025 - 35th Update!

the grind never stops huh? well, packages are slowly moving across the world (but not around here just yet), so tracking lots of them right now! JLCPCB already manufactured all the PCBs, and is strarting to ship! also around this time, LCSC has packed the singular MOSFET's package and that's sent to ship! aliexpress has three things ready, both AWG wires, and some screws! ok, now you're all caught up, its 5:49 PM here in NYC, and its hot outside! im your host for tonight, so lets get this rolling!

ok, enough of that, time to start printing! so, we have some... uh... 40 bracket rings to print. yeah, this one might sting. anyways, i guess 8 batches of 5? lets get printing! nah, hows 4 batches of 10? (i might regret this)

also, forgot to mention yesterday, but i am indeed keeping track of all the stats of this on yet another spreadsheet! ok, 5:58 PM, and we're off! starting to print the first batch...

layer 3, ramped it up to ludicrous speed... ok, been a bit, hearing some VERY rough grinding sounds from the other room, hopefully the nozzle isnt destroying itself again.

ok, so its just a bit tough to slide in, but should be ok! just need a bit of convincing to slide in. anyways, batch 2 is going right now! ok, finished printing the bracket rings at 7:02-ish PM (which also happened to be the time the rain started to kick in). ok, off to dinner now!

back at 8:30-ish PM, printing again!

ok, 9:54 PM, got the bracket bits all printed, time for the spacers! kinda scared about this one... turned on supports (it just made brims) so hopefully it all stays together. printing 3 at once right now! (a smarter idea would be splitting them in half, now that i think about it...)

hmm is this smart though? printing it vertically? we wouldnt want it splitting by itself, but if the layer lines are parallel to the plane of the screw going in, if we accidentally hit it too hard, wouldnt the layer lines be weak and detach? basic structure should keep everything together in the event one fails, but is this the correct move? well, we also dont want everything spliting, since the way we are thinking about it is that it'll be squished by the two arms screwing in. however, we dont want to rip layer lines, as printing it on its side would do, so i guess we just keep going? its probably also a good idea not to print it in two pieces as being one piece to hold the top and bottom together is kinda its point...

watched layer 140 through 180 and im still terrified

layer 271... (277 in total)

277! and it printed! on ludicrous speed!

ok, 10:50 PM, walked into the room for layer 277 to be printed! ok, so inner spacers done (they look way smaller than i thought they would be), time to do the outer ones! woah, these are 285 layers tall...

just did a bit of java coding for FRC, been a while! anyways, layer 169 for the tall spacers!

ok, so thats how things look like now! stuff all finished printing around 12:00 AM, currently 1:00 AM now in NYC, since i got a bit focused on FRC and some art, so yeah, that's it for me today! it seems like we've gone through all the parts that need to be printed that dont depend on the motor specs, so yeah, that's it for now! here's what the printing checklist looks like:

![woo](</updatelogs/images/202507/07302025 - 2.png>)

so yeah, all the non-electronics and screws and nuts stuff is what's left for printing!

ok, good night!
