# 7/19/2025 - 24th Update!

so today i went to the zoo. for like the entire day. was pretty fun, but that was a LOT of walking. why is hackatime say that i spent 2 minutes ai coding. what does that mean (i removed all the copilot extensions and disabled the features a while ago?). anyways, back to CAD! currently have mc open in the background just clearing out a large area automatically (if only we could achieve such good pathfinding in frc...), so yeah, time to fix some CAD and write firmware! (9:00 PM right now!)

thinking back to yesterday, i think that its probably better if we just make the entire spacer have a smaller inner diameter, instead of a just a bit on the top and bottom, since we'd want the entire length of the screw inside material (it will be a pain to thread it though)

the entire assembly, in fact, did not explode! thats shocking... mightve said that too early, all the M4 30mm screw replicates contain errors

9:30 PM now, gonna quickly do something and be back, back at 9:45 PM!

so i cant really solve this screw problem. yeah. so i guess ill figure that out in the future? ok, BOM time! ill assemble this into a chart, but im just gonna toss over some links and stuff for now

        - 4S 20A not found yet



why is digikey loading so slowly

ok, still writing the BOM (yes, these messages will not be in order for you, but whatever), and its 11:20 PM. im feeling kinda tired so ill be back in like 10 minutes or so.

*comes back at 1 AM*

ok time to continue

im tired, list almost complete, just some electronic bits for the board and finding the 4S 20A overdischarge protection and assembling the list! good night!
