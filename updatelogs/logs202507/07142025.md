# 7/14/2025 - 20th Update!

started at 5:45 PM, just updated the journal with the last 3 days! calculating the time for some of them were ridiciously hard, but yeah, we're back! anyways CAD time!

so we have to make this shaft collar REALLY strong, since the entire weight of everything else is relying on it, so i guess we design it to be a bit smaller than the actual design, so that it has to "squeeze" it in order to have a tight fasten? then the next question is how to attach everything else... i guess making vertical holes is alright? the shaft collar has to be printed sideways, since that would maximize grip strength (dont want the layer lines splitting). i guess ill coat it with something?

ok, 6:15 right now, gonna eat dinner real quick

ok, 7:15 now and im back! its raining pretty hard here in NYC right now

some progress on the shaft collar...

research says that PLA sucks for shaft collars (funny behavior under heat) but it'll probably be fine right... (famous last words). ill probably shove random stuff inbetween it when i tighten the thing, while blowing air on it, so itll hopefully have more pressure? oh yeah, forgot to mention, this is a two piece shaft collar! (yeah, i just realized that the entire mass of this thing is relying on the operation of two screws)

ok, searching through my pla 3d printing waste bag, im gonna see the effects of squishing pla together! yeah, dont know what i was expecting, but squishing pla together does NOT make it fuse. yeah dont know what i was thinking. anyways, i got some extra ideas incase out shaft collars dont work! ok, so just added one, its a little extension bit about the shaft collar to make sure it doesn't slide down (it can slide up though), so we can add a fan blade pointing upwards to push the top half down wards if we need. that's a pretty sus idea if you havent noticed.

yeah so we're cutting clearance verrrrrrryyyyy close here, but it'll be alright

hold on a second i just realized this is mechanically impossible to assemble, one second... never mind, it actually is possible to assemble. ok, so you can close the shaft collar, but you cant open it. well, if you're opening it, it probably means its broken, so i guess its unnecessary? or just get longer screws

ok the solution is to buy 35mm M4 screws. since they come in sets of 20, i guess that would be 30 for the big spacers and stuff, and 6 for the collar shaft, and 4 for the future support stuff, then 40 small screws for all the LED panels, and that should be it? idk, thats for BOM later

you know, i would love to CNC some of these parts, except i dont exactly have a cnc.

wait a second, those two things are probably gonna collide

ok, now we have a REALLY big shaft collar, but it shouldn't collide? might collide with the lower bit connection now, but we'll see

ok, all we have to do now is make the connection from lower pcb to mount the motor, then connect the shaft collar to the upper bit, then assemble the whole thing (in the assembly of course, not real life just yet)

ok, just moved some stuff on the PCB so that we have more space for these supports! just got an idea, instead of having vertical supports from each one, we can have two quarter "shields" that provide more support than one skinny cursed spacer! also probably looks better. (wait let me DRC real quick)

ok, here it is!!!

yah looks ok, anyways, top mounting and bottom mounting now. since things are a little weird, i kinda need **long rods** in my BOM, as in, we dont exactly have space for a clean mounting solution (as in, more holes), so its probably better to shove a long rod in replacement of a screw there. that sounds like a horrible idea, lets not do that. oh wait, this is just silly, we just do the same thing we did on the top on the bottom, then make some triangle cone shape thing for support

ok, time to do good parametric cadding by using variables, time to update every feature! (we have 61)

actually, 0.42mm is probably good for a lot of stuff, so gonna just update the reallly necessary ones

wait i just realized, we're really covering up the motor's "air cooling" intake

ok, bottom mount updated! might need to get 40mm screws now, but looks good! now we just need to do the little bottom support triangles. also, we forgot the place to put the battery and other electronics (oops). it's meant to be like a little thing that sticks out, but we'll see in COG analysis! (and real life, since the PLA parts aren't going to be 100% infill)

you know, sometimes its nice to show all sketches and hide all parts...

ok, its 10:16 PM now, im gonna brb (probably near 11:30 or something idk) (imma commit now)
