# 7/29/2025 - 34th Update!

ok, so its 1:08 PM right now, since we were supposed to have a trip today but turns out its way too hot here in NYC, so we're going online today. ive already did everything, so here's a brief summary of whats happened!

last night, before going to be at 2:35 AM in the morning, checked the hack club slack and saw i got the go for the updates, and bought all the stuff in bed. so turns out i forgot to unfreeze the card, so i had to unfreeze it and do it again. anyways, now, gotta do the reciept stuff! basically, its just battery holders and the M4 16mm screws (took me like 10 minutes)

ok here's the transactions!

(the declined one was because i forgot to unfreeze the card oops)

so yeah! $225.93 left in the grant card, only spent $124.07, so thats less than $150, so thats pretty cool! now, time to start printing...

ok, its 1:21 PM, im gonna get back into this meeting

huh 500 layers! started preparing at 4:30-ish PM, and its now 4:46 PM! lets see how long this prints for, slicer is say 1 hour and 6 minutes, but we'll see! here we go!

ok, also logging this stuff in our spreadsheet!

ok, just set the speed to sport speed! hopefully it doesnt fail (this is NOT foreshadowing.)!

8:22 PM, just did a filament swap! time to print out the bottom plate, pretty sure i wont get to finishing the arms today! looking over the cad, i feel a little nervious with only 0.39cm of radius around the motor supports and the spinning bit. i guess we just have to balance it really well?

you know what, i guess itll be fine.

hmm just took it off the hotplate... hotplate? oops buildplate, and it feels weirdly statically charged? after a couple minutes it seems to have lost it, but this is one of the prettiest parts ive ever seen! ok, arms now i guess? wait, actually, before that, the shaft collar washers!

ok, 9:55 PM, decided to also do the motor's top mounting too! ok, 10:09 PM now, printed!mightve accidentally licked some of the printer lubricant thingy oops

gotta say, things always dont look like the scale they do when CADing. was expecting this to be kinda bigger than i imagined, while when making FRC robots, they look smaller than they actually are (or just dont really feel any similarity in size?)

ok, motor bottom mount, then arm time! ok, 10:35 PM, exporting stuff...

its 11:58 PM! printed 9 arms (straight), and 3 arms (diagonal). currently, made a lapse in judgement, and currently printing another set of 3 arms (diagonal). too late to really stop it, so i guess we'll just have an extra 2? (currently have an extra arm (straight), but thats ok).

been a bit, been drawing some art lol, but here's all the parts printed today!

ok, so, for the list of things that don't depend on the motor shape, we have the bracket rings, bracket spacers, and arm spacers left (oh those spacers are gonna use a LOT of filament arent they...)! so yeah, its 12:42 AM now, good night!

also one more thing, all the printing files (step and 3mf) are also here! check out the [`/printing/`](</printing/>) folder! ok, good night!
