# 7/12/2025 - 18th Update!

ok, so its 4:00 PM now, yes i woke up at 1:00 PM, i had like the most insane dream

anyways, last night, spent a couple minutes (like 15-ish?) thinking up of how we should do the programming side of things (which i seem to have forgot to include inside the schedule plan?) control wise I think I got it, PID and getting interval timings based on code execution time compared with the internal clock synced with the device. basically/specifically, im wondering about how we would represent LED patterns in the instructions so that it runs any combination we like

so a light "value" can be represented by 5 numbers: the individual RGB values, start angle, ending angle! 0 degrees could be wherever the magnet is for the hall effect sensor (since, its a good reference point for the LED logic itself and for us). but how would someone represent a light moving to the right at 10 degrees/second? maybe with some form of action keywords? like:

```
// create new light
NEW LIGHT “name”
// set light angle speed (derivative of 1) by 10
SET “name” ANGLE 1 10
// pause until the 10 second mark
FOR 10
// set light angle speed to 0
SET “name” ANGLE 1 0
// delete the light
DEL LIGHT “name”
// variables
NEW VAR “deg”
```

however, when you start going to mega complex stuff, things get confusing, like we're planning on some form of compiler for this, but what if there are 10 lights moving left and right? how would one encode that? or a bit with rapid flashing lights everywhere? probably gonna have different "modes" such as "scatter" or something that just defines the stuff, i guess a GUI and compiler would be good for this.

additionally, i realized that the spinning bit also makes the machine a display, so i think it would be cool for the initial display to display some rotating text, like "RAVEN" *spin spin* "V1" *spin spin spin* or something, idk, just control over every line of LEDs would be pretty cool! anyways, back to the PCB! we got two PCBs to try to complete today!

yeah, 5:07 PM now, pcb design does take a while... ok, 5:41 PM, design mostly good, working on silkscreen now!

ok, 6:18 PM, and the first PCB is done!

![yay](</updatelogs/images/202507/07122025 - 1.png>)

gonna quickly commit, then update something on the LED panel, then do the motor PCB!

ok, gonna go to eat dinner now, just updated the LED panel fill so that it now has a solid conenction to the correct pads! (so, the ground pad is fully connected to the ground fill pour!) ok, its 6:26 PM now, see ya! (motor PCB next!)

ok whose linting the [`LICENSE`](</LICENSE>) file.

![cursed](</updatelogs/images/202507/07122025 - 2.png>)

ok, its 8:30 PM now! time to start working on the motor subsystem PCB... (does this mean JLCPCB is gonna send a total of 15 pieces of copper to me (3 different PCBs)) also, forgot to say, the LED subsystem PCB actually now has 3 LEDs on it! this is to create 3 "rings" that can be used for various purposes! speaking of which, i just realized i need to update the firmware folder to have two different firmwares, one for the led sybsystem and one for the motors!

anyways, 20A! yeah its 9:10 PM now and still connecting stuff! looking at it now, this 1N5822 looks rather small to handle 20A, lemme just double check that its rated for it... oh its not, guess i need to find another diode!

ok, here's one, the [30SQ045](https://lcsc.com/product-detail/Schottky-Diodes_LGE-30SQ045_C2903878.html?s_z=n_30SQ045)! it also has a [datasheet](https://lcsc.com/datasheet/lcsc_datasheet_2410121844_LGE-30SQ045_C2903878.pdf)! ok, updated the PCB and stuff (couldnt find a symbol or footprint online so i just put in some placeholder diodes and some big diode footprint that should work!) ok, time for measuring the motor size and stuff! hey, looks like they restocked their 150W motors? anyways, the datasheet on the site doesnt exactly provide very useful measurements, as far as distance between the motor bits go, so i guess im gonna do... idk, the diameter of the motor decreased by a bit? ill look around for more data first

yeah so i cant really find good info about the distance between the two "prongs" of the motor, i guess ill just make a reasonably sized hole and just connect it with a wire in the future?

yeah so i actually forgot to add the hall effect sensor on the motor pcb... oops, gonna fix that right now

so these traces are so so so large, that trying to fit the mosfet on it is getting weird

ok, once again, i got jumpscared that we might not be able to power the STP55NF06L, theres a *chance* we might not be, since the max gate threshold voltage (for it to be fully open) isnt specified, and that graph is confusing as heck to read, so here's a [IRLZ44N](https://lcsc.com/product-detail/MOSFETs_UMW-Youtai-Semiconductor-Co-Ltd-IRLZ44N-UMW_C42370423.html?s_z=n_IRLZ44N) with the max gate threshold voltage being 2V, so it should be fully open! [here's](https://lcsc.com/datasheet/lcsc_datasheet_2506261420_UMW-Youtai-Semiconductor-Co---Ltd--IRLZ44N-UMW_C42370423.pdf) the datasheet!

ok, 11:32 PM update, been staring at this datasheet for quite a while, we might need some mini heatsink or something for the MOSFET, just really worried about it being too much for it

ok, so it should be good now? wirings super cursed, and tried to do the triangle thing as best as i could, guess someone should look over that?


ok, its 12:25 AM now, and here's the current (haha get it amps) (im going crazy) state of things:

![waw](</updatelogs/images/202507/07122025 - 3.png>)

yeah, so those are some very big traces. somethings bothering me, the ESP32-C3 isnt centered... also, we current are using the STP55NF06L footprint right now, while we're supposed to get the IRLZ44N. they have the same shape/footprint, but i should probably add some text on the silkscreen or something... actually i'll do that right now

ok, stuff updated! feels a little empty on the bottom, but we should maximize the support we get (10cm x 10cm boards are $2 on JLCPCB, so might as well maximize on how much PCB space we get) we should also find some way to add mounting holes, but that's for tomorrow! that also depends on the CAD, so we'll see! ok, good night!
