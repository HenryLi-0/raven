# 7/12/2025 - 18th Update!

ok, so its 4:00 PM now, yes i woke up at 1:00 PM, i had like the most insane dream

anyways, last night, spent a couple minutes (like 15-ish?) thinking up of how we should do the programming side of things (which i seem to have forgot to include inside the schedule plan?) control wise I think I got it, PID and getting interval timings based on code execution time compared with the internal clock synced with the device. basically/specifically, im wondering about how we would represent LED patterns in the instructions so that it runs any combination we like

so a light "value" can be represented by 5 numbers: the individual RGB values, start angle, ending angle! 0 degrees could be wherever the magnet is for the hall effect sensor (since, its a good reference point for the LED logic itself and for us). but how would someone represent a light moving to the right at 10 degrees/second? maybe with some form of action keywords? like:

```
// create new light
NEW LIGHT “name”
// set light angle speed (derivative of 1) by 10
SET “name” ANGLE 1 10
// pause until the 10 second mark
FOR 10
// set light angle speed to 0
SET “name” ANGLE 1 0
// delete the light
DEL LIGHT “name”
// variables
NEW VAR “deg”
```

however, when you start going to mega complex stuff, things get confusing, like we're planning on some form of compiler for this, but what if there are 10 lights moving left and right? how would one encode that? or a bit with rapid flashing lights everywhere? probably gonna have different "modes" such as "scatter" or something that just defines the stuff, i guess a GUI and compiler would be good for this.

additionally, i realized that the spinning bit also makes the machine a display, so i think it would be cool for the initial display to display some rotating text, like "RAVEN" *spin spin* "V1" *spin spin spin* or something, idk, just control over every line of LEDs would be pretty cool! anyways, back to the PCB! we got two PCBs to try to complete today!

yeah, 5:07 PM now, pcb design does take a while... ok, 5:41 PM, design mostly good, working on silkscreen now!

ok, 6:18 PM, and the first PCB is done!

![yay](</updatelogs/images/202507/07122025 - 1.png>)

gonna quickly commit, then update something on the LED panel, then do the motor PCB!

ok, gonna go to eat dinner now, just updated the LED panel fill so that it now has a solid conenction to the correct pads! (so, the ground pad is fully connected to the ground fill pour!) ok, its 6:26 PM now, see ya! (motor PCB next!)
