# 7/13/2025 - 19th Update!

ok, so today is the day of the yearly charging of the mouse! the battery lasts like a year on a charge for some reason, but yeah! also, while eating breakfast (at 1 PM since my sleep schedule isnt cursed), i remembered that we forgot to add the hall effect sensor on the motor subsystem PCB! so yeah, thats what we're doing first! (yeah i wrote i was gonna do it yesterday and just forgot)

since my mouse is charging, im gonna try to do this with my trackpad, what could possibly go wrong?

ok so turns out i just forgot to add the holes and stuff for the hall effect sensor

ok, should be good now? tried to keep it as far from the motor as i could (also, just realized that the vanity on both boards both say core pcb, fixing that right now!)

ok, 1:44 PM now and it should be good! broke out another pin on the XIAO (pin D9) which happens to be right next to the MOSFET controlling pin, so it would be a nice backup in the event that D10 explodes! also shifted the MOSFET and ground stuff closer to each other to minimize heat thingy, along with making the pads ridicilously big for heat stuff. ok, off for lunch now!
