# 7/13/2025 - 19th Update!

ok, so today is the day of the yearly charging of the mouse! the battery lasts like a year on a charge for some reason, but yeah! also, while eating breakfast (at 1 PM since my sleep schedule isnt cursed), i remembered that we forgot to add the hall effect sensor on the motor subsystem PCB! so yeah, thats what we're doing first! (yeah i wrote i was gonna do it yesterday and just forgot)

since my mouse is charging, im gonna try to do this with my trackpad, what could possibly go wrong?

ok so turns out i just forgot to add the holes and stuff for the hall effect sensor

ok, should be good now? tried to keep it as far from the motor as i could (also, just realized that the vanity on both boards both say core pcb, fixing that right now!)

ok, 1:44 PM now and it should be good! broke out another pin on the XIAO (pin D9) which happens to be right next to the MOSFET controlling pin, so it would be a nice backup in the event that D10 explodes! also shifted the MOSFET and ground stuff closer to each other to minimize heat thingy, along with making the pads ridicilously big for heat stuff. ok, off for lunch now!

ok, its 2:16 PM, just came back from lunch! ok, so, since i cant CAD right now (mouse still charging, ill just leave it alone for now, even though it probably already is at 100% or something), im gonna start doing some firmware stuff!

wait im gonna brb in like 15 minutes, ok im back

ok so just updated the LED pcb to breakout the D8 pin as a backup for the hall effect sensor, all that needs to be done is to destroy the previous traces and link up a couple other ones in order to swap pins!

ok its 2:48 PM, brb, ok we're back at 3:20-ish! just updated the LED pcb to fix a little missing trace thats been bothering me, mouse is at 85%, gonna wait for 100% to start CAD! (i did just use it for half an hour to do something, but whatever)

yeah imma make this object oriented... its 3:45 PM, brb, ok its 4:00 PM now! ok, just wrote some logic for the LED subsystem stuff! gonna quickly commit, then do some motor firmware!

uh how do i write a pid controller from the ground up

ok, back from a little quick mosim break, i think the pid controller is good? im gonna quickly test it after taking a bit away (its 5:40 PM right now and im kinda tired) (even though i woke up at 12 PM)

back at 6 PM, somethings definitely wrong (theres no I value)

ok, so the issue was that i put very high constants and that my testing setup was messed up (i used `=` instead of `+=`), but it seems to work now! now how to implement trapezoid profiles...

ok, its 6:52 PM now, just gonna commit (kinda tired, starting CAD next!) (firmware isnt close to done, but we have a start)

ok, 10:15 PM and mouse seems stuck at 93%? anyways, CAD time! im starting to question whether this is a safe idea, but, i mean, ive been next to a speedy ankle biting robot before and some very fast spinning wheels, so this should *fine* (i might regret saying this). all i have to do is not activate it around expensive stuff! and maybe plastic wrap it or something (bad idea, heat might get stuck), anyways, just wear safety goggles or something

ok yeah so we kinda have a problem, this cad is gonna need lots and lots of changes... (trying to flip this thing upside down)

slowly getting there

ok 11:15 PM, im gonna take a quick mosim break

ok back at 11:30 PM, its super hard to think of where to set things up since we dont have actual measurements on the big fat part of the motor, but im planning on trying to make a 3D printable hub or something to connect to the round shaft

no way, frc 1778 chill out reference

![chill out](</updatelogs/images/202507/07132025 - 3.png>)

yeah so its 12:30 AM, cleaned up the features, pretty tired now, here it is! (gonna finish tomorrow ig)

ok, thats it, good night! also, considering mounting the stuff for the motor PCB facing the bottom? might protect the stuff from the spinning disc more? (the status LEDs are whatever, pretty noticable?) probably actually a pretty smart move

ok, good night!
