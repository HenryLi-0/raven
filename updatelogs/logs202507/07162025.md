# 7/16/2025 - 21st Update!

what happened to 7/15/2025? well, i kinda got distracted with YOLO (like, computer vision) and made a model that detected white toilet paper roll cardboard thingies. apparently im also one of them (there were no picture of people in the dataset so thats probably why). anyways, currently, forcing another laptop to train it off of a bunch of FRC game pieces, and its been running for like... 9 hours? epoch 22/50-ish (yeah i dont exactly have a beefy GPU laying around)

anyways, im back! its 5:41 PM, lets see how long my laptop lasts (its at 31%). ok, its actually now 6:00 PM and that other laptop is still going! ok, cad time!

6:17 PM update, here's how it looks! still need to add all the screws (theres gonna be a lot of them), and the electronics area, but so far so good! i also removed the extra spacer, bringing out lower clearance to 1.2cm!

its 7:21 PM and i think thats a couple screws

![waa](</updatelogs/images/202507/07162025 - 3.png>)

so uh i cant even count how many there are, so im just gonna measure the total volume and divide it by the volume of one of them! so there are $\frac{24.943163}{0.639568}$ (39-ish) M4 40mm screws and $\frac{31.44751}{0.388241}$ (81-ish) M4 20mm screws. whats funny is that they come in batchs of 20 (if i remember properly), so that kinda means that i should get rid of one screw somewhere... ok, removed the center one (this cant possibly go wrong right) so we now have $\frac{31.059269}{0.388241}$ (80-ish) M4 20mm screws! (wait so we have like 120-ish screws... wow)

i dont wanna add these bolts D:

ok its 7:40 PM, ill add those bolts later!

just kidding i updated the pcb with the mounting holes!
