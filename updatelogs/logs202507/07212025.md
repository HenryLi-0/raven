# 7/21/2025 - 26th Update!

today does not exist (as in, shouldnt have). anyways, its 11:23 AM (my sleep schedule is horrible), time to continue writing code! ok its 11:29 AM and now its lunch time.

ok its 6:23 PM, came home a bit ago, but back to programming!

ok, lots of work going on in the led firmware, currently thinking of the equation to measure the rotation position, at least mathematically wise. ok, this markdown file shall be my rubber duck.

so we need to find the rotation position in a given timestamp (now). so, using the hall effect sensor, we can estimate the RPM, which is good. say, we are currently at 1k RPM, we can tell how long each rotation takes by taking the reciprocal (so, 1/1k = 0.001 seconds). however, we need to find our position, so we can take our timestamp and modulus it by the length of time per rotation, so we can find out how much time "into" the rotation we are. for instance, (0.0015 % 0.001 = 0.0005), meaning we are 0.0005 seconds into the rotation. then, we have to divide by the length of time per rotation to get how much of the rotation is complete (0.0005/0.001 = 0.5). therefore, we are 50% into the rotation!

so therefore, our calculation is `(TIME % (1/RPM))/(1/RPM)`. we might as well store `1/RPM` into a variable to make it more compact, say `(TIME % n)/n`. looking back, this logic is a little flawed when we consider that rapidly changing hall effect sensor number will confuse the heck out of the system (since, modulus doesn't fit "exactly" into everything), so we might need to implement something with a counter and time difference if this appears broken. we also need to take care of when `RPM = 0`, i guess just add `1e-6` or something there

now thinking about how to implement the color data stuff (for now)...

ok 7:17 PM now, gonna commit and eat dinner!

got distracted by mosim and its now 9:14 PM (oops). anyways, more led work time! for now, i guess we'll just have a simple scripting system that just has a rainbow swirling around (more advanced stuff if we can find out how to do this). 

so ngl, every time i want a smooth LED rainbow, i always go back to the [LED subsystem from our 2024 robot](https://github.com/SciBorgs/Crescendo-2024/blob/main/src/main/java/org/sciborgs1155/robot/led/LedStrip.java#L52) and copy that function (since, it worked really well, imo)

well, that seems to be working! gonna quickly make a visual testing setup (no we are not bringing in IVO... yet)

ok, got the matplotlib thing working, seems good so far!

i think the LED subsystem code is good for now? i mean, sure, needs testing irl, but i think the logic works ok for now? added some docs too! ok, time to finish the motor subsystem firmware...

still need to implement the bluetooth stuff, but its probably better to figure that out before soldering anything

ok its 10:05 PM, im gonna go check mc quickly

my internet just blew up again. anyways, im gonna watch a movie

ok, back at 12:06 AM! i think the motor subsystem is pretty much good (only thing for now could be feedforward?), so im gonna commit it! we're gonna need to figure out the bluetooth stuff before writing more control code, but im gonna have to have the microcontroller in hand to test it with! ok, quick commit, then back to cad, hope that i dream up some solution to the MOSFET issue tonight (it would be really funny if i magically had a lucid dream tonight (ive been trying here and there for like 2 years at this point, maybe i actually try in august? oh wow a third of summer is over already))

ok, we have x80 ($\frac{27.038031}{0.337975}$) 16mm screws! first part of the problem solved... hmm x24 30mm screws, gotta change 4... you know, i cant actually do this without messing up some stuff, since those 24 are used for the 2 layer x 2 screws x 6 arms? wait i just got a good idea, we can just add some spacer to the top or bottom and call it an "expansion" thingy, since we'll have to mount electronics on the extra arm anyway.

yay! the screw issue is solved! we have x80 ($\frac{27.038031}{0.337975}$) 16mm screws, x20 ($\frac{10.278091}{0.513905}$) 30mm screws, and x20 ($\frac{12.791366}{0.639568}$) 40mm screws! and some 86 nuts! in the assembly, there's 100 total instances and 57 mate features!

ok, its 1 am now, CAD needs a little bit of clean up, but its presentable now! good night, hopefully can assemble a complete BOM and start preparing this repository for presenting tomorrow! (and whatevers left for submitting). ok, good night!

ok quick update, i was about to commit, then i remembered we still need to sort out the MOSFET thing and check for electronics to CAD collisions. but anyways, good night!
