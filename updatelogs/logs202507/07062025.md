# 7/6/2025 - 12th Update!

yeah so we kinda gotta finish this...

just did a little research on the reviews of yesterday's overdischarge stuff, and it seems good! only downside is that its a *little* expensive (dont worry, welcome deal here! not sure how many deals i can get...) so, i guess we need to redraw the wiring diagram! (its 9:30 PM right now) wait a second, why does it say supply voltage 12V to 36V, guess this isnt the product for that!

so we need the entire battery output, but overdischarge protection to stop lower battery sus activity, so the battery should be able to deliver its stated 20A, but not get restrictied by the TP4056's 1A dishcharge thing (which is also one reason we arent including it on the spining bit now)

ok i gotta go for a second (its 10 right now), since my cousin is currently doing something in texas (i have no clue whats going on) ok three minutes later, and i guess they just diappeared off the face of the earth? i dont really know, gonna go back to search on aliexpress and LCSC, oh looks like theyre back

also the MT3608 that we had earlier does 2A max, which isnt enough... however, heres a [battery charger protection thing](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256807120302984.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.main.1.11115eb9tU5tMV&algo_pvid=17b15dd3-c056-4c08-8b4d-3a71811ebffa&algo_exp_id=17b15dd3-c056-4c08-8b4d-3a71811ebffa-0&pdp_ext_f=%7B%22order%22%3A%2212577%22%2C%22eval%22%3A%221%22%2C%22orig_sl_item_id%22%3A%221005007306617736%22%2C%22orig_item_id%22%3A%221005007296858433%22%7D&pdp_npi=4%40dis%21USD%213.27%211.64%21%21%2123.30%2111.65%21%402103277f17518531947346287e3da2%2112000040176986833%21sea%21US%216405565024%21ABX&curPageLogUid=Ibhrdg7VpNy4&utparam-url=scene%3Asearch%7Cquery_from%3A) (choose 2S 20A Balanced)! (uh idk if running this on only one battery would work?) yeah idk if this is the move, its layout looks super cursed, and im not exactly sure buying 4 batteries is the move. looking into making my own overdischarge protection circuit (bad idea), and i see a minecraft comparator reference

theres no way im soldering that
