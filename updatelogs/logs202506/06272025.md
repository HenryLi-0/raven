# 6/27/2025 - 3rd Update!

so i havent check the slack in a while, an i really want to do the poster thing (looks pretty cool!), so we need to get this in by 6/29/2025, or at least the poster, to my understanding. ok, so whats on the todo list?

- parts and materials
    - motors
    - batteries
- placement
    - LED PCB
    - weight distribution (and ability to tune it in the future)
    - safety shell (since, its kinda spinning really fast)
- firmware
    - timing and stuff
    - calculations for light flow
    - figure out bluetooth stuff
- editor
    - figure out how to make this easily editable
        - might use a text file (probably shouldnt make a tape clone for this)
    - figure out how to store this data (and load it onto the microcontroller)

so yeah, lots of things to do! in like, three days!

yeah so now its 10:30 PM at night and i havent done like anything, so i guess time to turn on some music and start hackin! (had to take a blood test thing today, flowed much better than last year! anyways, back to this!)

1. the diameter (and display ig)
    - in order to have a spinning wheel of ~~death~~ LEDs be effective in actually showing light in sections of the room, we have to take into account the size of the LED "panel" (like, the physical dimensions of the LED matrix)!
    - for the rest of this point, ill take about the diameter, NOT the radius!
    - $>30 cm$ is a little sus, since at that point it could get hard to control, as it seems a little large for a small motor to handle. additionally, that's like... the size of like a large plate. like its kinda big.
    - $<15 cm$ might be a bit tiny, which would make attaching our panel a little silly (and we need to make a case anyways, so it wouldnt really work?)
    - but first, we need to note the PCB? since, of course, the necessary raidus really depends on the distance between the LEDs and thus the size of the PCB!
        - neopixels have a $120\degree$ beam angle, which is *kinda* really wide for our purposes (tons of overlap between LEDs!)
        - this means that things WILL blend, which is *really* bad for our purposes (we want to be able to cleanly split sections of the room!)
        - ideally, we need the LEDs to have like $10\degree$ of spread, or *less*, which means we probably need to do something with lenses, cones, and walls
        - so, how? probably block walls on the side that slope inwards. but wastes tons of light! so next idea...
        - TALL PCB! instead of a 7x7 matrix, a 2x25 matrix with this inwards slope would be MUCH better, as it's way less obstructive. but unfortunately, thats TALL. like, if we smack each LED next to each other, each one is like 0.5cm, thats 25 cm tall, which would be really not compact
        - it would be way better to split it into 5 pcb, so its portable, and we also utilize all the PCBs JLCPCB sends over, so we're also not wasting things! that makes it roughly 5-7cm per side! it also lets us increase exposure time for each side, so the lighting should be the same! (less lights, but more times exposed per revolution)
        - so whats the PCB size? dunno. like 1 cm wide per segment, with walls that can be tuned in the future!
    - so, in conclusion, i have no clue. through some experiments involving using a single LED on my hackpad to see the effects (sorry no pictures, i was kinda using both hands at once), it seems that this angle for the walls probably will have to be tuned in the future!
    - just played around surrounding my macropad with filament boxes and learned this: light likes to spread. like alot. at least when it coems to these LEDs. (see photo below!)
    - so what did we determine? nothing, but we learned a lot! so for now, roughly $25 cm$ seems like a reasonable diameter, so let's stick with that until we get more things understood!

2. balance
    - the LED PCB will have to be balanced, but the heaviest thing (other than the motor likely), are the batteries! we aim for wireless, since we cant exactly tether it when its spinning really fast. well, you could use a slip ring, but thats not exactly inside budget.

3. positioning
    - we plan on using a hall effect sensor for stuff, since we're going fast enough anyways! additionally, its cheap! since we're assuming a $25 cm$ diameter, we should use some wires to connect it to a placement near the center. this is because we REALLY want to clear out the noise that could occur when its near stuff!
    - since we're using bluetooth, is making the microcontroller spin gonna cause issues? in theory... no? but we'll try to keep it close to the center of the PCB, of course only to a certain extent!
    - of course motor in the center, battery to offset weight, the COG near the center bottom
    - we'll have locations where we can attach weights (sand ig? or like liquid glue? idk) and tune our system!
    - to figure anything else out, WE NEED PARTS!!!
    - ~~for the safety shell, say hello to my buddy plastic wrap~~ (this is for future concern!)

4. code
    - firmware and control algorithms should be hopefully written tomorrow?
    - editor is kinda a future thing at this point, since its kinda a LOT, and kinda depends on how the system acts! (after microcontroller firmware)

5. conclusion
    - we need part specifics!
    - we need a design!
    - we need code!

so, narrowed down our focus today, so we'll hopefully get things up and running tomorrow! first will be PCB design! here's my plan for BOM

| Item                   | Price  (USD) |
|------------------------|--------------|
| Microcontroller        |   $ 5 -  7   |
| Motor                  |   $10 - 15   |
| PCBs (both)            |   $ 8 - 12   |
| LEDs (all)             |   $ 3 -  5   |
| Sensors/Wires          |   $ 2 -  5   |
| Printed Parts          |   $ 0 -  0   |
| Shell ~~plastic wrap~~ |   $ 0 -  0   |
| Total                  |   $28 - 44   |

so, we should be able to stay within our budget! of course, those $6 might be used in random stuff as we flesh out our exact parts, but thats decent headroom! Turns out... I already have an idea for the microcontroller!

The [seeedstudio XIAO ESP32-C3](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Seeed-XIAO-ESP32C3-p-5431.html), including bluetooth and wifi capabilities, with other specs being actually kinda bettter than the XIAO RP2040! best yet, its only $5, within the budget!

before i look at a bunch of memes before sleeping tonight, ill do some research with motors! ideally, pretty light, can achieve 1k-3k RPM, (so like 16-50 rotations per second)! of course, we should aim to make the spinning part as light as possible, but we'll see! ok, see ya tomorrow! good night! (also, i wanna draw some art for this release... might not come out in time, who knows!)
