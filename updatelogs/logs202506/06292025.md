# 6/29/2025 - 5th Update!

ok, so last night, before i went to sleep (at 4:15 AM, help my sleep schedule is progressively getting worse and worse), i remembered that i forgot to model the buck convertors in the wiring diagram! here's the updated thing (on paper this time though)

![waw](</updatelogs/images/202506/06292025 - 1.png>)

so, PCB time! currently a little after 3 PM right now! (also, just realized, how am i gonna solder this???)

ok, update! i might actually change it to 5 panels with 10 LEDs each! (turns out, i dont think i can easily solder a 2x5 panel without absolutely messing up (since i dont have a reflow plate thing), so ill do 1x10)

so i dont think i can solder 2 mm preceision... ok 5mm might work

ok, 4:12 PM now, i think the LED panel's good!

![wooo](</updatelogs/images/202506/06292025 - 2.png>)

(yes, i finally figured out how to make the holes that you can solder things through!)

oh wait i forgot to add mounting holes (M2, 2.2mm holes???)

also, just did some research, jumper wires probably arent the best idea for the LED power... just updated yesterday's list of parts! 20 AWG seems to work for power things (and data lines too), so should be good! anyways, just bumped up the track widths of the LED panel, since those skinny 0.2mm are NOT gonna handle like up to 3V, so yeah!

~~why does it look like a stick of ram~~

anyways, gonna quickly commit now! (its 4:53 PM!) next stop... the core PCB! (yeah idk what to call it)

ok its now 6:00 PM and i got distracted by a card trick (oops), so back to PCB work!

ok found some resistors: [from aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256805483786320.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.main.3.68b125f4Dj2utb&algo_pvid=afd9f67a-3ae5-4ee2-ab52-2d1e553d8175&algo_exp_id=afd9f67a-3ae5-4ee2-ab52-2d1e553d8175-2&pdp_ext_f=%7B%22order%22%3A%222418%22%2C%22eval%22%3A%221%22%7D&pdp_npi=4%40dis%21USD%212.03%210.99%21%21%2114.45%217.06%21%402101eac917512379422191296ed7f6%2112000033959206034%21sea%21US%216405565024%21ABX&curPageLogUid=kfuQkg0ObEyF&utparam-url=scene%3Asearch%7Cquery_from%3A)

need a 10kΩ (heh alt code is Alt+234) and a 100Ω resistor! (aliexpress please stop shipping me twenty, i only need one)

found some beefy diodes (to protect motor from backpowering or anything) [from aliexpress (this gives me all of them, including the normal diodes)](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/2251832446756419.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.main.3.2b2f28d1vkaD0d&algo_pvid=79ec799f-32cf-45e9-9fcf-b9cf38dce966&algo_exp_id=79ec799f-32cf-45e9-9fcf-b9cf38dce966-2&pdp_ext_f=%7B%22order%22%3A%222134%22%2C%22eval%22%3A%221%22%7D&pdp_npi=4%40dis%21USD%212.16%210.99%21%21%212.16%210.99%21%402103205117512386822514662ebacb%2112000016563917366%21sea%21US%216405565024%21ABX&curPageLogUid=1TofX5J4nMVF&utparam-url=scene%3Asearch%7Cquery_from%3A)

ok, its 7:18 now, heading off for dinner! oh wow its now 8:18 PM, turns out dinner was exactly one hour?

why does the STP55NF06L footprint or something keep crashing kicad.

ok i fixed the issue, but this first iteration of the core PCB looks super uhhh... ugly. it also has very bad wiring, so im gonna actually redo it!

ok, so i dont think im finishing by 12:00, which means no poster D:

however, the core PCB still looks very sad. still working on it! ok quick update, its 11:36 PM, and im enduring the pain of making a whole bunch of traces. turns out, this PCB isn't the friendliest to do this stuff.

ok, its 12:40 AM now, haven't super checked over the wiring, but DRC thinks its ok, gonna quickly run it by omniscient ai to see what it thinks! ok, its 1:03 AM now, and things look good! gonna add some vanity, then start preparing to CAD tomorrow!

ok, 1:26 AM, think its pretty good!

![tired](</updatelogs/images/202506/06292025 - 4.png>)

i added some text wrapped around the center spinning circle! hopefully it turns into a blur when spinning, sort of like a CD! (huge shoutout to Krita for doing this! put the text in krita, used some tool, wrapped it around, then imported it into KiCAD as a footprint with the image converter!)

anyways, that's basically it for me tonight! today was quite the day (tons of PCB design pain), CAD should be ~~just as painful~~ ok, so that's tomorrow! i do need to start planning out the rest of summer, since we only have like 12 days until undercity! (i very likely wont go, since no way parts arrive on time, but we'll see)

oh right, gerbers! ill quickly commit first! (oh its 1:31 AM already? interesting)
