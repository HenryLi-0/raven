# 6/29/2025 - 5th Update!

ok, so last night, before i went to sleep (at 4:15 AM, help my sleep schedule is progressively getting worse and worse), i remembered that i forgot to model the buck convertors in the wiring diagram! here's the updated thing (on paper this time though)

![waw](</updatelogs/images/202506/06292025 - 1.png>)

so, PCB time! currently a little after 3 PM right now! (also, just realized, how am i gonna solder this???)

ok, update! i might actually change it to 5 panels with 10 LEDs each! (turns out, i dont think i can easily solder a 2x5 panel without absolutely messing up (since i dont have a reflow plate thing), so ill do 1x10)

so i dont think i can solder 2 mm preceision... ok 5mm might work

ok, 4:12 PM now, i think the LED panel's good!

(yes, i finally figured out how to make the holes that you can solder things through!)

oh wait i forgot to add mounting holes (M2, 2.2mm holes???)

also, just did some research, jumper wires probably arent the best idea for the LED power... just updated yesterday's list of parts! 20 AWG seems to work for power things (and data lines too), so should be good! anyways, just bumped up the track widths of the LED panel, since those skinny 0.2mm are NOT gonna handle like up to 3V, so yeah!

~~why does it look like a stick of ram~~

anyways, gonna quickly commit now! (its 4:53 PM!)
