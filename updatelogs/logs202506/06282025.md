# 6/28/2025 - 4th Update!

back again! its 3 PM on saturday! first thing: part search! we need:

- Microcontroller
- LEDs
- Battery stuff
    - Battery itself
    - Charging bits
    - Buck convertors or anything
- Motor
- Materials (for parts and stuff)
- Hall Effect Sensor
    - (and magnet!)
- Jumper Wires

also, not related, but new ivycomb album!!!!! anyways, im gonna listen to it in the background while searching for parts! (so far, sounding really good!)

after reviewing the project guidelines, i *think* this could really be a 6 point project, with up to $150 in funding, but i'll realistically aim to keep it less than $50 (or $100) if i can, since if i break any parts, i should be able to get them myself without going too broke! realistically, shipping may cause us to poke a little bit above (ahem ahem, certain person, ahem), but yeah

- Microcontroller:
    - SeeedStudio XIAO ESP32-C3: as said yesterday, fills features nicely!
        - SeeedStudio: [yippee](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Seeed-XIAO-ESP32C3-p-5431.html)
        - Firmware: [circuitpython is amazing!](https://circuitpython.org/board/seeed_xiao_esp32c3/)
- LEDs
    - WS2812B (Neopixels): classic led, pretty efficient (60 mA draw, worse case (20 mA is more realistic))
        - Digikey: aint no way that 50 neopixels are $34
        - AliExpress: [wow they sell individual leds? gotta do a little background check first](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/2251832590417125.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.main.32.600a5d3b1yP1iM&algo_pvid=c5f6ef35-37ce-4857-bcf3-4a71905f647e&algo_exp_id=c5f6ef35-37ce-4857-bcf3-4a71905f647e-32&pdp_ext_f=%7B%22order%22%3A%2238%22%2C%22eval%22%3A%221%22%7D&pdp_npi=4%40dis%21USD%215.89%213.53%21%21%215.89%213.53%21%402101e7f617511386739062844eafa4%2112000035383967669%21sea%21US%216405565024%21ABX&curPageLogUid=oTkc8tOCmXek&utparam-url=scene%3Asearch%7Cquery_from%3A)
            - sketchy, might need to buy an LED strip and just steal the neopixels from there
- Battery Itself
    - Samsung INR18650-25R: seems to be good, hold charge for a while
        - im trying not to get scammed by some sketchy companies
        - IMR Batteries: [seems legit from what ive seen?](https://imrbatteries.com/products/samsung-25r-18650-2500mah-20a-battery?_pos=1&_sid=150b0caf3&_ss=r)
- Charging Module
    - TP4056 (with safety)
        - AliExpress: [seems pretty trustworthy](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256807959506419.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.main.3.3b635853RjHF9a&algo_pvid=7fb60844-e3e3-4a4f-96c7-897a3b00b699&algo_exp_id=7fb60844-e3e3-4a4f-96c7-897a3b00b699-2&pdp_ext_f=%7B%22order%22%3A%221177%22%2C%22eval%22%3A%221%22%7D&pdp_npi=4%40dis%21USD%212.47%210.99%21%21%2117.61%217.06%21%402103146f17511506194958391e7fef%2112000044264539066%21sea%21US%216405565024%21ABX&curPageLogUid=gSqGfju7UfXL&utparam-url=scene%3Asearch%7Cquery_from%3A) (choose type c!) (mfw lead warning)
        - i think that ones protected? nearly got one that was unprotected
- Buck convertor
    - MT3608
        - AliExpress: [looks good](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256806175499915.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.main.1.74ef6433JXc5jv&algo_pvid=a6aa944f-5777-4952-9073-caa6a39f0688&algo_exp_id=a6aa944f-5777-4952-9073-caa6a39f0688-0&pdp_ext_f=%7B%22order%22%3A%225088%22%2C%22eval%22%3A%221%22%7D&pdp_npi=4%40dis%21USD%211.43%210.99%21%21%2110.19%217.05%21%4021030ea417511512431732865e7423%2112000036895232308%21sea%21US%216405565024%21ABX&curPageLogUid=ZKZczbJpqT9P&utparam-url=scene%3Asearch%7Cquery_from%3A) (probably best to use the welcome deal and stuff, might be more worth it to get 3 instead of 2 pieces)
        - need to look into this! not exactly sure how they allow the user to change voltages?
- Motor
    - 775 motor
        - was gonna buy from vex robotics but shipping is atrocious
        - Amazon: [pwease gimme ur amazon pwime account](https://www.amazon.com/Torque-Bearings-Wheels-Upgrade-Bracket%EF%BC%89/dp/B0BW73LMP7?source=ps-sl-shoppingads-lpcontext&ref_=fplfs&smid=A1NVF2KXHRYMP6&utm_source=chatgpt.com&th=1)

        - DigiKey: [shipping might be scary](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/stmicroelectronics/STP55NF06L/1039551)
- Materials
    - Likely PLA from my 3D printer (thanks arcade!) for a majority of structural parts!
    - Likely need a couple screws (maybe nuts?) to screw it into the structure
- Hall Effect Sensor
    - A3144
        - AliExpress: [its called A3144E but seems to be ok](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256805644436949.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.main.3.7539tznWtznWkZ&algo_pvid=7173316d-07ab-495c-89fb-293d7414fb92&algo_exp_id=7173316d-07ab-495c-89fb-293d7414fb92-57&pdp_ext_f=%7B%22order%22%3A%22828%22%2C%22eval%22%3A%221%22%7D&pdp_npi=4%40dis%21USD%214.69%210.99%21%21%2133.40%217.05%21%402101ea7117511403107531206eb465%2112000034504336157%21sea%21US%216405565024%21ABX&curPageLogUid=VaieOt5mf26T&utparam-url=scene%3Asearch%7Cquery_from%3A)
- Magnet
    - some random small neodymium disc magnet (all mine have like chipped into pieces)
        - AliExpress: [i dont need 50 pieces, i need like one or two!](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256808695821393.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.main.9.5b3334f915BtSZ&algo_pvid=aee2dc40-9ab5-42d2-8f9e-716258dc3d6e&algo_exp_id=aee2dc40-9ab5-42d2-8f9e-716258dc3d6e-45&pdp_ext_f=%7B%22order%22%3A%223931%22%2C%22eval%22%3A%221%22%7D&pdp_npi=4%40dis%21USD%213.71%210.99%21%21%2126.45%217.06%21%402103244b17511406317204415e0629%2112000047073358390%21sea%21US%216405565024%21ABX&curPageLogUid=3egb4bJCmrQb&utparam-url=scene%3Asearch%7Cquery_from%3A)
- Jumper Wires
    - realistically, cheapest one that rated nicely would probably work
        - AliExpress: [eh](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256801814340687.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.main.4.2141p0mFp0mF7u&aem_p4p_detail=202506281747233414044354293600001787464&algo_pvid=fc09a167-a6c0-456c-a4b2-1ec021cc4bba&algo_exp_id=fc09a167-a6c0-456c-a4b2-1ec021cc4bba-3&pdp_ext_f=%7B%22order%22%3A%222580%22%2C%22eval%22%3A%221%22%7D&pdp_npi=4%40dis%21USD%212.30%210.99%21%21%212.30%210.99%21%402101eac917511580431171509ed7f6%2112000018371624180%21sea%21US%216405565024%21ABX&curPageLogUid=DscDSYJKQj0M&utparam-url=scene%3Asearch%7Cquery_from%3A&search_p4p_id=202506281747233414044354293600001787464_1)
    
hey, so ive been doing some thinking... it might actually be smarter to split the systems and have two systems thats powered by the xiao! let me break it down! the original idea was this: single battery, powers everything. but this is kinda bad, since we only have a single battery (the tp4056 doesnt really get charging multiple at once, or at least in a safe way, as far as i know). this means low battery life, and possible struggles in keeping things spinning. additionally, brownouts would affect the ENTIRE system. the new idea is to have two systems, each with its own battery (and therefore charging module). one is solely dedicated to the motor, and one is dedicated to the logic and LEDs. this makes sure that any brownouts (battery running low or anything) would be isolated. the xiao will control some transistor/MOSFET on the motor side, which will command the motor to spin or not! (this does mean the GND on both sides need to be connected at some point, probably by connecting the `BAT-` of both TP4056)

woo, that was some typing! somehow part searching took three and a quarter hours of hunting on aliexpress and across the internet! gonna quickly sketch a wiring diagram (of course, not with the actual electronics symbols, but you get it)

![wiring!](</updatelogs/images/202506/06282025 - 1.png>)

ok, time to start making the circuit! (that drawing took like twenty minutes!)

suprise suprise, i need to find footprints and symbols for like everything!

ok, just found the ones for the XIAO ESP32-C3, just need to find how to install them... wow, success!

huge thanks to https://github.com/ccadic/TP4056-18650 for the TP4056 footprints!

ok, still working on the PCB, hopefully gonna finish it tomorrow! got lots of research done today, just lots of designing tomorrow! ok good night
