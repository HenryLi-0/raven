# 6/30/2025 - 6th Update!

ok, nearing a week soon! today's CAD day! or more like tomorrow, since its actually 2 AM on 6/30/2025, and i just pushed the commit with the 6/29/2025 log (im a little too excited to work on this)

but since that's cad day, im actually gonna work on some of the firmware now! ok so its 2:37 AM now, and i got the theoretical settings and startup done, so now all the logic (predictive RPM and timing) needs to be done. gotta search this up, but hopefully it has decimal time tracking (as in, `time.time()` returns a decimal), since if it only returned whole numbers, that would make things a little less accurate!

ok, good night, see you tomorrow morning! (cad cad cad)
