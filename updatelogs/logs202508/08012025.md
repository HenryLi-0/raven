# 8/1/2025 - 37th Update!

so... guess what came in while i was coming home from school today?

![yay](</updatelogs/images/202508/08012025 - 1.png>)

yep, currently 9:45 PM at night, gonna open them up! they really are XIAO (get it haha), although i see the one on the hackpad, i still was suprised that it was that small! so, turns out, they do come with headers! for the first experiment, im gonna try to conenct to it from my computer and make it... idk, do something. unboxing time!

*yoink*

i still cant comprhend the size of this thing. its TINY! im gonna definitely mess up soldering this... gonna check the docs since i really dont want to break this! ok, so as far as i can tell, its basically a similar process to setting up circuit python on the XIAO RP2040?

gonna drop some links here:
- [circuitpython](https://circuitpython.org/board/seeed_xiao_esp32c3/)
- [docs](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-with-esp32-quick-start/overview)

ok, so it isnt how you setup a XIAO RP2040. alrighty.

shouldve gotetn an ESP32-S3. whatever, lets try to figure this out... uh, its just not showing. yeah.

hey, guess what the issue was? in pure desperation, i plugged in the USB-C upside down, and it works! ok, trying to figure out how to boot this...

uh maybe erasing the flash was a bad idea

uh its taking a bit

ok, went to watch a movie at 10:45 PM, and now its 12:33 AM. i can not figure out this error?

```
Error: Invalid head of packet (0x45): Possible serial noise or corruption.
To run the new firmware, please reset your device.
```

ah the solution was to try a lower bandwidth. just tried `115200 Baud` and seems to work!

hmm trying to do the wifi setup stuff, started doing something after i realized i needed to stick the attenna on... ok! just figured out how to connect to it! and its not melting! great!

ok, that's gonna be it for today (its already 1:16 AM somehow), so yeah, if tomorrow's weather is nice and cool like tonight, might do lots tomorrow! ok, good night!
