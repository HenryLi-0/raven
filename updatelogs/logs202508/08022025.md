# 8/2/2025 - 38th Update!

ok, 3:45 PM here on saturday! my sleep schedule is absolutely messed up, but we're back! gonna try to make this a bluetooth activatable device or something, then see if i can control an LED from my computer!

ok, so last night i continued playing with it, and figured a couple stuff out:

- `time.time()` only returns whole numbers
- `time.monotonic_ns()/(10**9)` returns decimal time tracking, but it appears to be relative to when it was turned on or something (up to 3 decimal places after the decimal point it seems)

so i was searching some [docs](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/blob/main/ports/espressif/README.rst#connecting-to-the-esp32-c3). and uh i think it hasnt been implemented in circuitpython yet? hmm found [this seeedstudio page](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/xiao_esp32c3_with_circuitpython/) about the xiao esp32c3 with circuitpython but doesnt seem to metnion bluetooth...? oh something about UART

nvm, seems like [it is supported](https://docs.circuitpython.org/en/latest/shared-bindings/_bleio/index.html)? ok [here](https://docs.circuitpython.org/projects/ble/en/latest/) now, that was a bit too low level

so its actually supported but also apparently isnt (see the [support matrix](https://docs.circuitpython.org/en/latest/shared-bindings/support_matrix.html)). i guess we use wifi for now?

yo!

![yay](</updatelogs/images/202508/08022025 - 1.png>)

should i make a specfic firmware for just testing things? i guess so... seems like the frequency i can send info to this LED over internet is 0.25s difference (so thats like 4 messages per second which isnt too bad)

256 characters per second (64 every 0.25s) seems pretty decent, if we can compress our data we can probably achieve that level! ok, gonna make the testing firmware folder stuff

hmm seems to work eh on 0.25s, couple blended messages, but should be fine with better logic?

ok 5:25 PM now, gonna go do something else, so here's a commit!
