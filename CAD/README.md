This folder contains files for printable parts! Additionally, the OnShape link shows what the finished product should look like, along with exact dimensions. It is recommended that you checkout and use the parts from OnShape, since lots of parametric CADing was done (some measurements are not exact, so you can adjust them with the Variable Studio), and since all the updates are there (I, personally, would not enjoy exporting 26 parts every time I made a change.)
