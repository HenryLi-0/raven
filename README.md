# Raven

[Raven](https://github.com/HenryLi-0/raven/) is an open source disco party light, built for Hack Club's [Highway](https://highway.hackclub.com/)! 


#### Introduction
Since being introduced to a LED strip during FRC at the start of 2024, I realized I really like LEDs. Like a little too much. This could also be seen with the 10 LEDs from my [Hackpad](https://github.com/hackclub/hackpad/pull/224) back in October 2024 and when I brought it on a trip in June 2025. 

Now inspired by the lights at the venue, that brings us here! Introducting Raven, a spinning LED display that uses 49 LEDs on a single PCB, spinning *really* fast. Using precise timing, angular prediction, and wireless control, Raven is capable of producing sector-based effects, rainbow gradients, strobes, and more, room wide! All parts can be sourced relatively cheaply, with the entire project aimed to cost less than $50.
